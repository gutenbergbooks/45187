</div>


<p><span class="drop-cap-p">I</span>t is not always from the
closest and most accurate
historian that we receive
the truest picture of an
age or of a character.
The artist gives a more real picture than
the photographer; and it needs imagination
and sympathy, as well as labour and
research, to make a hero of old time live
again to-day. The minutest investigation
will hardly better the vivid reality of
Scott's James I. or Charles II., or portray
more truly than Mr. Shorthouse has done
the fragile yet fascinating personality of
Charles I. Yet to say this is not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
undervalue history or to contemn the
labour of true students. Rather, without
their aid we cannot rightly see the past at
all: it comes to us only with the distortions
of our own prejudice and our narrow
modern outlook. We need both the work
of the scholar and the imagination of the
artist. Without the first we could not
behold the past, without the second we
could not understand it.</p>

<p>In religion, in politics, in art, in all
that makes life beautiful and men true,
we must know the past if we would use
the present or provide for the future.
And our knowledge is barren indeed if it
does not touch the intimacies of human
existence. What we must know is how
men lived and thought, not merely how
they acted. We must see them in the
home, and not only in the senate or the
field. It is thus that the Letters of Erasmus,
or Luther's Table Talk, are worth a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
ton of Sleidan's dreary commentaries or
Calvin's systematic theology. And yet
we cannot dispense with either. We must
study past ages as a whole, and then bring
the imagination of the artist and the poet
to show us the truth and the passion that
lies nearest to their heart. It is thus, then,
in history that the imaginary portrait has
its valued place.</p>

<p>Saturated with contemporary literature,
yet alive to the influences of a wider life,
the student who is also an artist turns to
a great movement, and with the touch of
genius fixes the true impression of its soul
in poetry, on canvas, or in prose. Such
was the work of Walter Pater. He
taught us, through the delicate study of
a secondary but most alluring painter, to
"understand to how great a place in
human culture the art of Italy had been
called." In his picture of a great scholar
and a beautiful, pathetic, childlike soul, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
showed the fascination of that priceless
truth&mdash;that what men have thought and
done, that what has interested and charmed
them, can never wholly die&mdash;"no language
they have spoken, nor oracle beside
which they have hushed their voices, no
dream which has once been entertained
by actual human minds, nothing about
which they have ever been passionate or
expended time and zeal."</p>

<p>And more. He taught us not only how
to understand the past, but he showed us
how it understood itself. "A Prince of
Court Painters"&mdash;Watteau, as he was
seen by one who loved him, by a sympathetic
woman&mdash;like all such, the keenest
of critics, yet the tenderest of hearts&mdash;is
given to us as not even pictures or personal
letters could give. Sebastian van
Storck, Duke Carl of Rosenmold&mdash;they
are portraits, though it is only imagination
that makes them live.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>
<p>I remember Mr. Freeman once saying
to me, as he took me his favourite walk
at Somerleaze, that he had read a study
of Mr. Pater's&mdash;a strange mediÃ¦val story
of Denys l'Auxerrois&mdash;and could not be
satisfied till he knew what it meant.
Was it true? It was a question befitting
one who had made the past to live again.
Truth was the first, almost the only, thing
the historian prized. Denys the organ-builder
may never have watched the decoration
of the Cathedral of Saint Ã‰tienne,
or made, by the mere sight of him, the old
feel young again. And yet Walter Pater
had painted a true portrait, as so often did
Robert Browning, though it were imaginary;
and the artist as well as the historian
had imaged for us the reality of a
past age.</p>

<p>Mr. Pater, though the most perfect
artist of this school, was not the first.
Humbler writers have long endeavoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
to draw the great heroes as they thought
their contemporaries saw them, by a fiction
of memoir, or correspondence, or journal.
And the "Prince of Court Painters" is
a sketch in the same medium as "The
Household of Sir Thomas More."</p>

<p>This charming book has passed through
many editions, but its author, of her own
choice, remained almost unknown. The
"Dictionary of National Biography" has
strangely passed her by. Almost all that
her wishes suffer us to know is that she
was sister of Mr. William Oke Manning,
to whom she affectionately dedicated the
fourth edition of the book which is now
reprinted; that she was never married;
and that she was a genuine student and
an indefatigable writer on historical and
literary subjects. In "Mary Powell" she
touched the heart of her generation, and
few books of its day had a wider circulation.
"The Household of Sir Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
More" is a still more painstaking study,
and a more complete and delightful portrait.
Its perfect sympathy and its quaint
charm of manner secured for it a welcome
even among those who claimed for the
hero and his opinions a sanctity which
Miss Manning's historical judgment did
not ratify. Cardinal Manning, writing
on March 11, 1887, rejoiced at its republication,
and said: "The book is a
singularly beautiful one, and I regret that
I had not the pleasure of knowing the
writer, whose mental gifts were of a very
high order." Miss Manning was a keen
critic of the Romanism of the Reformation
period, as her Appendices to the
fourth edition of her book show; but she
did not suffer her own opinions to destroy
her sympathy for him whom Reginald
Pole called "the best of all the English."</p>

<p>"The Household of Sir Thomas More"
is an imaginary portrait of a noble character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
It professes to be the journal begun
by Margaret, More's eldest daughter, most
learned and best beloved, when she was
but fifteen years old, and continued till
she had taken her father's head from the
pole whereon it was exposed, to treasure
it till she should lay it on her breast
as she too passed into the peace of God.
Among "fair women" the heroic daughter
is immortal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Morn broaden'd on the borders of the dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I saw her, who clasped in her last trance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her murder'd father's head."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So Tennyson recorded the pathetic legend
with which Miss Manning ended her
beautiful book.</p>

<p>When she wrote, it was not so hard
as it is now to recall the London of
Henry VIII. Miss Manning herself described
very happily in 1859 what she
remembered many years before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>
<p>"When we say," she wrote, "that some
of our happiest and earliest years were
spent on the site of Sir Thomas More's
country house in the 'village of palaces,'
some of our readers will hardly believe
we can mean Chelsea. But, in those
days, the gin-palace and tea-garden were
not; Cremorne was a quiet, aristocratic
seclusion, where old Queen Charlotte</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Would sometimes counsel take, and sometimes tea.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"A few old, quiet streets and rows, with
names and sites dear to the antiquary, ran
down to the Thames, then a stranger to
steamboats; a row of noble elms along
its strand lent their deep shade to some
quaint old houses with heavy architraves,
picturesque flights of steps, and elaborate
gates; while Queen Elizabeth's Walk,
the Bishop's Walk, and the Bishop's Palace
gave a kind of dignity to the more modern
designations of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span></p>
<p>"When the Thames was the great highway,
and every nobleman had his six or
eight oared barge, the banks of the river
as high as Chelsea were studded with
country houses. At the foot of Battersea
Bridge, which in those days did not disfigure
the beautiful reach, Sir Thomas
More, then a private gentleman and eminent
lawyer in full practice, built the
capital family house which was afterwards
successively occupied by the Marquis of
Winchester, Lord Dacre, Lord Burleigh,
Sir Robert Cecil, the Earl of Lincoln, Sir
Arthur Gorges, Lord Middlesex, the first
Duke of Buckingham, Sir Bulstrode Whitlock,
the second Duke of Buckingham,
the Earl of Bristol, and the Duke of
Beaufort. It stood about a hundred yards
from the river; its front exhibited a
projecting porch in the centre, and four
bay windows alternating with eight large
casements; while its back presented a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
confused assemblage of jutting casements,
pent-houses, and gables in picturesque
intricacy of detail, affording 'coigns of
vantage,' we doubt not, to many a tuft of
golden moss and stone-crop. This dwelling,
which for convenience and beauty
of situation and interior comfort was so
highly prized by its many and distinguished
occupants, appears at length to
have been pulled down when it became
rickety and untenantable from sheer old
age&mdash;in Ossian's words, 'gloomy, windy,
and full of ghosts.'"</p>

<p>Nor was Miss Manning obliged to
rely only on her memory for a picture of
More's house as it had been. The site,
when she knew it, was like the New
Place at Stratford-on-Avon, where only a
few stones and foundations enable us to
picture how stood the house where Shakespeare
died. But while the household
was still fresh in men's minds, and More
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
was beginning to be reverenced as a martyr
and a saint, Ellis Heywood published at
Florence, in 1556, his sketch, "Il Moro,"
in which he set in a true description of
the Chelsea garden an imaginary picture
of the Chancellor and his friends talking
on matters of high import to soul and
spirit. "From one part of the garden,"
he tells us, "almost the whole of the
noble city of London was visible, and from
another the beautiful Thames, with green
meadows and wooded hills all around."
The garden had its own charm too. "It
was crowned with an almost perpetual
verdure, and the branches of the fruit-trees
that grew near were interwoven in
a manner so beautiful that it seemed like
a living tapestry worked by Nature herself."</p>

<p>So wrote Ellis Heywood of the external
beauty of the scene. Of the
inner harmony Erasmus had written years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
before to Ulrich von Hutten:&mdash;"More
has built himself a house at Chelsea.
There he lives with his wife, his son,
his daughter-in-law, his three daughters
and their husbands, with eleven grandchildren.
There is not a man alive so
loving as he: he loves his old wife as if
she were indeed a young maiden." For
Dame Alice, whom More had wedded
very soon after the death of his first
child-wife, was <i>nec bella nec puella</i>&mdash;neither
a beauty nor a girl. And besides
these, in the year when little Margaret,
according to Miss Manning, began
to write in her "fayr Libellus" which
her tutor, Master Gunnel, gave her, there
were dwelling in the house the aged
father, Sir John More, good judge and
humorous man, with his third wife.</p>

<p>"And the household," said Erasmus,
"was a very 'platonic academy'&mdash;were
it not," he adds, "an injustice to compare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
it with an academy where disputations
concerning numbers and figures
were only occasionally mingled with discussion
on the moral virtues. I should
rather call his house a school of Christianity;
for though there is no one in
it who does not study the liberal sciences,
the special care of all is piety and virtue.
No quarrelling or ill-tempered words
are ever heard, and idleness is never
seen."</p>

<p>In such a household it was that Margaret,
More's dearest and most heroic
child, was nurtured:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">"As it were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An angel-watered lily, that near God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows and is quiet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She was one of those fine souls to
whom come alike learning and love, and
in whom religion shows its fairest fruits.
Holbein draws her with a Seneca in her
hand, but not far away is her prayer-desk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
All the children answered to their
father's careful culture, for it is an idle
tale that makes young John More but a
silly fellow. Elizabeth, who married Mr.
Dancey, Cecily, who became the wife of
Giles Heron, a ward of her father's, the
step-daughter Alice, who became Lady
Alington, and the adopted child, Margaret
Giggs, whom young Clement, sometime
their fellow-scholar, wedded, were
all instructed in humane letters. But
Margaret was the flower of them all.
To her her father wrote when she was
still but a child:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you, dearest Margaret,
how pleasant to me are your most delightful
letters. Now, as I was reading them
there chanced to be with me that noble
youth, Reginald Pole&mdash;not so highly ennobled,
indeed, by birth as by learning
and every virtue. To him your letter
seemed a miracle, even before he knew
how you were beset by shortness of time
and other hindrances. And hardly would
he believe that you had no help from
your master, till I told him seriously that
you had not only no master in the house,
but that also there was no man in it
that had not more need of your help in
writing than you of his."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span></p>
<p>Indeed a good father and a good teacher
made the household the wonder of learned
Europe. See what More wrote to the
tutor he had chosen, when he was himself
abroad on an embassy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have received, my dear Gunnel,
your letters, such as they are wont to be,
full of elegance and affection. Your love
for my children I gather from your
letters; their diligence from their own.
I rejoice that little Elizabeth has shown
as much modesty of deportment in her
mother's absence as she could have done
in her presence. Tell her that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
delights me above all things; for, much
as I esteem learning, which, when joined
with virtue, is worth all the treasures
of kings, what doth the fame of great
scholarship, apart from well-regulated
conduct, bring us, except distinguished
infamy? Especially in women, whom
men are ready enough to assail for their
knowledge, because it is uncommon and
casts a reproach on their own sluggishness.
Among other notable benefits
which solid learning bestows, I reckon
this among the first, that we acquire it
not for the mere sake of praise or the
esteem of learned men, but for its own
true value and use. Thus have I spoken,
my Gunnel, somewhat the more in respect
of not coveting vainglory, because
of those words in your letter wherein
you deem that the high quality of Margaret's
wit is not to be depressed, which,
indeed, is mine own opinion; but I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
that they the most truly depress and
affront their wit who accustom themselves
to practise it on vain and base
objects, rather than raise their minds by
the study and approval of what is good
in itself. It mattereth not in harvest-time
whether the corn were sown by a
man or a woman, and I see not why
learning in like manner may not equally
agree with both sexes; for by it reason
is cultivated, and, as a field, sown with
wholesome precepts, which bring forth
good fruit. Even if the soil of a woman's
brain be of its own nature bad, and apter
to bear fern than corn, by which saying
men oft terrify women from learning, I
am of opinion that a woman's mind is,
for that very reason, all the more in need
of manure and good husbandry, that the
defect of nature may be redressed."</p>

<p>In these letters, and in many like them,
there is given the best, and the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
authentic picture of the household of the
great Chancellor.</p>

<p>Of More himself it is difficult to speak
without using language which seems extravagant.
His character was so beautiful,
his life so simple and so pure, his
conscientiousness so complete, his end so
heroic, that he stands out among the
sordid meannesses of the sixteenth century
like a single star in the darkness of the
world. Sinful popes and wicked kings,
greedy statesmen and timid clergy, who
will accept the king's supremacy one
day and then burn what once they adored&mdash;among
these More has no place. His
is a steadfast soul, happy in prosperity and
triumphant in the furnace of affliction.
"O ye holy and humble men of heart,
O ye spirits and souls of the righteous,
bless ye the Lord: praise Him and magnify
Him for ever."</p>

<p>And the position of More in the age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
of the Reformation is the more remarkable
because he belonged so clearly to
the new as well as to the old. He was,
in the best sense, a Humanist. He was
a scholar and a bitter foe of all obscurantism.
He fought the battle of Greek,
and so gave to England the scholarship
of the succeeding generation to which
true religion and sound learning owe so
great a debt. He could take no part
with those who could defend the old
faith only with the rusty weapons of a
philosophic system which had failed to
meet the aspirations of the new age. No
one laughed more readily than he at the
sallies of Erasmus against ignorant monks
and illiterate clergy. <i>Encomium MoriÃ¦,
EpistolÃ¦ Obscurorum Virorum</i>, spoke his
sentiments as well as those of their
authors. But while he loved the new
learning and adopted the new methods,
he saw that there remained something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
among the old things that was priceless
and imperishable. It may be that he did
not clearly distinguish between the essentials
and the mere offshoots of a divine
faith. It may be&mdash;we should say it must
be&mdash;that if he had lived a hundred years
later, or in our own day, he would have
thought differently on some matters. The
cause of intellectual freedom was presented
to him in its worst aspect, and the command
to cast away the childish things
of mediÃ¦valism came in a revolting form
from the lips of a coarse and brutal tyrant.
Had Colet lived, or Erasmus been a
stronger man, all might have been different.
As it was, More saw but one side
of the new world, and that the worst, and
he said, "The old is better."</p>

<p>But while, in his final choice, he seemed
to belong rather to the old world than
to the new, he had absorbed all the best
spirit of the Italian Renaissance, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
belonged as a social reformer to an age in
the far future. The <i>Utopia</i>, it is true,
was the work of his youth, and it is
doubtful if much of it was meant seriously,
and certain that some was distinctly contrary
to its author's mature convictions.
But nevertheless it sets forth an exquisite
ideal picture of equality in opportunity
and of simplicity of life. Its whole tone
speaks a protest against the selfishness and
the competition of the age that degraded
art and divided society. And this protest
was enforced by the asceticism of the
author's own life and the purity of his
household.</p>

<p>More's life was not a long one. He
was born on February 7, 1478. His
family was "honourable, not illustrious."
His father came to be an eminent judge.
As a boy he went to school in London,
and then was taken into the household of
the famous Cardinal Morton, Archbishop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
of Canterbury and Lord High Chancellor
of England, the statesman who advised the
best measures of Henry VII., who began
to reform the monasteries, who heavily
taxed the rich and took care for the poor.
There the young More was known as a
bright lad, who would often speak a piece
in Christmas games for the guests' entertainment
with a wit and readiness which
made the Archbishop prophesy for him
a great career. He went to Oxford; he
studied at New Inn, and then at Lincoln's
Inn. He became a lawyer; he went into
Parliament; he lectured publicly in London
on theology. When a young man he was
widely known as a scholar and a wit.
He was a friend of all the learned men of
his day, a member of that little circle of
students to which Colet and Grocyn and
Linacre belonged. Though he plunged
into practical life, politics, and law, and
exchanged epigrams with the best wits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
the time, his deepest thoughts were always
with religion. He was near becoming a
Carthusian; he had serious thoughts of
refraining from marriage; he lived very
strictly, and was with difficulty won from
a solitary life. When he decided to marry
and conform outwardly to the customs of
the society of his day, he did not abandon
the secret rules by which his personal
life was restrained. He was outwardly of
the world, but in spirit he was always a
recluse.</p>

<p>Gradually he came prominently before
his contemporaries. His books made him
known to scholars. Wolsey may have
known him at Oxford, and now found
him useful on embassies and at Court.
The King sought him out and made a
friend of him, would talk with him of
theological matters, obtained his help for
that book against Luther which won him
the title of "Defender of the Faith," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
often at night "would have him up to
the leads, there to consider with him the
courses, motions, and operations of the
stars and planets." So, when Wolsey fell,
More, who had already been Speaker of
the House of Commons, and won great
praise alike from King and Cardinal, became
Lord Chancellor&mdash;the first great
layman and lawyer who held that high
office. As judge men spoke of him with
admiration for centuries. He was a statesman,
too, as well as a lawyer, and his aid
was sought in all Henry's foreign negotiations.
He might have been the greatest
man in England after the King if he
would have strained his conscience. But
this he would not do. He never approved
the Divorce; he was known to be a champion
of the injured Queen Katherine, and
a friend to her nephew, the Emperor
Charles. As Church questions, too, came
in dispute, he took more and more the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
conservative side. He would not repudiate
the Pope's supremacy, or separate
himself from the imposing unity of Christendom,
which it seemed to him was
threatened by the nationalism of Henry
VIII., as well as by the heresy of Luther.
And so at last it came that the lion felt
his strength: it was More's own prophecy,
and he was one of the first victims.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 13, 1534, he was
required to take oath to the succession of
the issue of Anne Boleyn, and in repudiation
of the validity of the first marriage
of the King. He at once refused. He
would not deny to swear to the succession,
but the oath put before him he could not
reconcile with his conscience. In this
he persisted. Imprisonment, trial, death,
came naturally and inevitably; and of
these Miss Manning, with the letters and
memoirs before her, has made the faithful
Margaret write as from a full heart.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span></p>
<p>On Tuesday, July 6, 1535, he was
executed on Tower Hill. "He bore in
his hands a red cross, and was often seen
to cast his eyes towards heaven." He
died as he had lived, with saintly calm,
and still playing with a gentle humour.
"That at least," he said, as he drew aside
his beard from the block, "has committed
no treason."</p>

<p>The King's wrath did not cease with
the execution of his faithful counsellor.
Dame Alice More lost all, and had hard
stress for the few years that remained to
her of life. Happily his son and his
daughters had all been married before the
troubles came. Margaret's marriage was
a happy one. Will Roper was soon
weaned from his "Lutheran" fancies, and
lived, thirty-four years after his wife, to
write an exquisite and pathetic memoir
of the great Chancellor. When the tyrant
was dead More's family seemed almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
sacred in the eyes of the nation. His
memory was cherished, and memorials of
all kinds poured forth during the years of
Mary's reign; and when Elizabeth had
been twenty years on the throne Roper
died in peace, desiring to be buried with
his "dear wife," where his father-in-law
"did mind to be buried."</p>

<p>Margaret Roper herself died in 1544,
and was buried in Chelsea Church. Her
monument is, with the Ropers', in S.
Dunstan's, Canterbury. In that ancient
city the family of her husband had long
dwelt, and the house itself lasted till this
century. Of it Miss Manning very prettily
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My friend, Mrs. George Frederick
Young, who was born in the Ropers'
house at Canterbury, tells me that it was
of singular antiquity, full of queer nooks,
corners, and passages, with a sort of dungeon
below, that went by the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
'Dick's Hole,' the access to which was
so dangerous that it at length was forbidden
to descend the staircase. The
coach-house and harness-room were curiously
antique; the chapel had been converted
into a laundry, but retained its
Gothic windows. At length it became
needful to rebuild the house, only the
old gateway of which remains. While
the workmen were busy, an old gentleman
in Canterbury sent to beg Mrs. Young's
father to dig in a particular part of the
garden, for that he had dreamed there
was a money-chest there. This request
was not attended to, and he sent a more
urgent message, saying his dream had been
repeated. A third time he dreamed, and
renewed his request, which at length
was granted; and, curiously enough, a
chest <i>was</i> found, with a few coins in
it, chiefly of antiquarian value, which,
accordingly, were given to an archÃ¦ologist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
of the place. Here my information
ceases."</p>

<p>More and his favourite daughter are
those of whom we first think when
we try to recall some memories of the
"Christian academy;" but their famous
guests must not be forgotten. I cannot
speak now of the soldiers and diplomatists,
the priests and scholars, who
pass across the scene so rapidly as we
read the letters of the Chancellor himself
or the memoirs of his son-in-law and his
great-grandson. But two names stand
out as famous above the rest, and as both
among the closest of those friends whom
More delighted to honour,&mdash;Erasmus the
scholar and Holbein the painter.</p>

<p>Of Erasmus who shall speak in a few
words? Are not the libraries of Europe
full of his books, and are not his witticisms
still repeated to-day as if they
were but the new thoughts of the newest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
of moderns? The intellectual life of his
age seems summed up in his person. It
had no interest in which he did not
mingle, nor any opinion which he did
not weigh and test. If he held himself
above its passions, it was simply because
his was a keen critical nature, loving in
its own fashion, but too cold to sympathise
deeply with any combatant or to
thrill with any passion. "He had no
mind," said Miss Manning rather sharply,
"to be a martyr, but only to suggest
doubts which led braver men to be
such."</p>

<p>"This worthy man," says his eighteenth
century biographer, Jortin, "spent a laborious
life in an uniform pursuit of two
points: in opposing barbarous ignorance
and blind superstition, and in promoting
useful literature and true piety. These
objects he attempted in a mild, gentle
manner, never attacking the persons of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
men, but only the faults of the age. He
knew his own temper and talents, and
was conscious he was not fitted for the
rough work of a reformer."</p>

<p>Jortin's, indeed, is the juster estimate.
It was Erasmus's keen sight, not his want
of moral courage, which prevented his
being a martyr. He could not sympathise
with the foreign reformers; he
had no taste for antinomianism, still less
for ignorance, and he saw that the Church
abroad, with all its accretions,&mdash;which
none ridiculed so wittily as he,&mdash;still
preserved a treasure that the human mind
could not afford to lose.</p>

<p>Erasmus was a lifelong friend of More.
They had met originally in England
while Henry VII. was still on the throne.
Erasmus stayed at More's house, and together
they discussed the wrongs and
follies of the time. <i>Encomium MoriÃ¦</i>&mdash;"The
Praise of Folly"&mdash;was written by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
Erasmus under More's roof, and the title
had a punning reference to the author's
host. Later books, especially the great
edition of the New Testament which
made the sacred text, said More, "shine
with a new light," had all of them the
sanction of the faithful English friend.
He had to suffer rough handling from
the obscurantists of his day. Greek
seemed to savour of heresy, just as now
to some it seems a relic of mediÃ¦valism
unworthy of the study of a scientific age.
Erasmus, indeed, was in a position which
has its parallel to-day. He stood boldly
forth to fight for a large and liberal
education, and for wide and rational
methods of instruction, against those who
would narrow the teaching of the young
to a merely technical and professional
training. He fought against the effort
to sacrifice sound learning to utilitarian
ends; and he found the warmest sympathy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
and the best expression of his
educational ideal, in the household of his
English friend.</p>

<p>With More he bore reproach for a
good cause. While the English lawyer
pleaded for the study of Greek at the
English universities, the Dutch scholar
met the assaults of those who would
check the publication of the New Testament
in the original tongue. He was
justly indignant at the treatment he received.</p>

<p>"There are none," he said, "that bark
at me more furiously than those who
have never even seen the outside of my
books. When you meet with one of
these brawlers, let him rave on at my
New Testament till he has made himself
hoarse. Then ask him gently whether
he has read it. If he has the impudence
to say yes, urge him to produce one passage
that deserves to be blamed. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
will find that he cannot. Consider, now,
whether this be the behaviour of a Christian,
to blacken a man's reputation, which
he cannot restore to him again if he
would. Of all the vile ways of defaming
him, none is more villainous than to
accuse him of heresy; and yet to this
they have recourse on the slightest provocation!"</p>

<p>A Dominican friar at Strasburg, who
had spitefully attacked Erasmus's Testament,
was compelled to own that he had
not read one word of it. "These men,"
exclaims Erasmus, "first hate, next condemn,
and, lastly, seek for passages to
justify their censures. And then, if any
one opposes them, and calls them what
they are, they say he is a disturber of the
public peace; which is just as if you gave
a man a blow in the face, and then bid
him be quiet, and not make a noise about
nothing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span></p>
<p>But all through the babel of contending
voices Erasmus kept his own course.
He could neither be coerced to give up
his liberal scholarship nor lured to ally
with Luther and the Protestant doctors.
To him the way of sound learning seemed
the path of the Catholic Church. And
here too he was of one mind with More.
The Englishman had to meet dangers
which never beset the foreign scholar,
and he met them, it may be, as Erasmus
would not have dared to do. But it
cannot be doubted that in their opinions,
as in their hearts, they were never really
divided.</p>

<p>In Mistress Margaret's <i>Libellus</i>, Erasmus
appears chiefly as a fellow of infinite jest,
but wise withal, chatting at table as he
chats in his letters, and saying, indeed,
much that we have under the safe warrant
of his own pen.</p>

<p>If Erasmus was the typical scholar of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
that age which stood between the Renaissance
and the Reformation, Hans Holbein
was typical of its art. In his hand
painting has come down from its high
estate, its Madonnas and its great Doges,
its classic pageants and its heroic legends,
and treats of common life as men saw it
every day. The German artist descended
from the lofty themes which had inspired
the great master of Italy, and took even
the humbler work of illustrating books.
Botticelli, it is true, had drawn studies of
the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, but Holbein was
ready to work for a printer, and to design
letters and tail-pieces for the <i>Libelli</i> of
his friends. It was through Froben, the
great Basle painter, no doubt, that More
and Erasmus and Holbein first came together.
Holbein illustrated the <i>Utopia</i>,
and came to England with an introduction
from the author of the <i>Encomium
MoriÃ¦</i>. He was thirty years younger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
than the Dutch scholar, and twenty years
younger than More, but they became his
chiefest friends. He tarried some while
in More's house, and it was there that he
drew some of those marvellous sketches
now preserved at Windsor, that give us
our truest knowledge of the Court of
Henry VIII. Fisher and Warham, the
Earl of Surrey and Sir Nicholas Poins,
Colet and Godsalve, each in their way
representative of a class, but keenly individual
and vigorously characteristic, are
preserved for us by those few sharp, bold
strokes with a power and reality which
no portrait-painter has ever surpassed.
The luxury and the meanness, the treachery
and the cold selfishness, that form
the background of the great struggles of
the sixteenth century are expressed for
all time in those master-sketches which
Holbein drew and Margaret Roper, it
may be, often looked upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span></p>

<p>And for More's own household we have,
besides the letters and the memoirs, the
very form and pressure from the great
artist's own hand. The original design
for the famous picture of the patriarchal
family, the three generations living together
in love and reverence in their
"Platonic Academy," is at Basle; but in
England, at Nostell and at Cokethorpe, we
have very fair presentments of the great
picture as it must have been. More sits
by his shrewd old father in his habit as
he lived. The gentle, delicate son stands
by, book in hand, and near his affianced
bride. The stepmother sits stately at one
side of the group, and the daughters cluster
around. The sorrowful eyes of the great
Chancellor, and his pensive, meditative
brow, speaking sound conscience and a
firm resolve, are not lightly to be forgotten;
and the plain, homely face of
Margaret Roper, refined and thoughtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
through all its solid strength, may well
linger in the memories of those who
know her beautiful life.</p>

<p>To the number of these Miss Manning's
book has added many. She teaches others
to love her heroes because she loved them
herself. Erasmus and More and Holbein,
Gunnel and Clement, Will Roper and
faithful Patteson, she knew as if she had
lived among them. These, and such as
these, are the characters of whom she so
skilfully drew portraits which were much
more than the fictions of imagination.
She wrote from a considerable knowledge
of the literature of the time, and with a
genuine love of all things beautiful and
good. In her style she imitated the
quaintness of old English without any
precise restriction to the period of Henry
VIII.; and in the same way the vocabulary
and the spelling which she adopted
were not claimed by her as minutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>
accurate. Over her book and her characters
I would gladly linger. But the first
speaks for itself, and my office is only
to direct readers to it; and for the characters,
what I can say is said in my own
Life of the great Chancellor and Saint
himself, the father of the gentle Margaret
whom Miss Manning so happily drew.</p>

<p>But there is a special feature in this
reprint of which I must needs say a
word. Mr. Herbert Railton and Mr.
John Jellicoe show that they too are
skilled in the drawing of imaginary portraits&mdash;that
they have seen More's house
as indeed we think it must have been, and
his family in their habits as they lived.
As the barge brings us past old London
Bridge to the Chelsea stairs, the mansion
of the Chancellor stands before us in the
warm sun as when Ellis Heywood saw it
three centuries and a half ago. The children
play in the garden, the Jew tells his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
story, the peacocks flaunt their gay colours,
and More reads his old books and cracks
his jests, as if the old time had come back
again. Bright pictures indeed, and a
worthy setting; and the old story is told
anew as More himself and Holbein might
have loved to think of it. But good
wines need no bush, and good pictures no
prologue.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">O</span>n asking Mr. <i>Gunnel</i> to
what Use I should put
this fayr <i>Libellus</i>, he did
suggest my making it a
Kinde of family Register,
wherein to note the more important of
our domestick Passages, whether of Joy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
or Griefe&mdash;my Father's Journies and
Absences&mdash;the Visits of learned Men,
theire notable Sayings, etc. "You are
ready at the Pen, Mistress <i>Margaret</i>,"
he was pleased to say; "and I woulde
humblie advise your journalling in the
same fearless Manner in the which you
framed that Letter which soe well
pleased the <i>Bishop of Exeter</i>, that he
sent you a Portugal Piece. 'Twill be
well to write it in English, which 'tis
expedient for you not altogether to
negleckt, even for the more honourable
Latin."</p>

<p>Methinks I am close upon Womanhood....
"Humblie advise," quotha!
to me, that have so oft humblie sued for
his Pardon, and sometimes in vayn!</p>

<p>'Tis well to make trial of <i>Gonellus</i> his
"humble" Advice: albeit, our daylie
Course is so methodicall, that 'twill afford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
scant Subject for the Pen&mdash;<i>Vitam continet
una Dies</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... As I traced the last Word, methoughte
I heard the well-known Tones
of <i>Erasmus</i> his pleasant Voyce; and, looking
forthe of my Lattice, did indeede beholde
the deare little Man coming up from
the River Side with my Father, who, because
of the Heat, had given his Cloak to
a tall Stripling behind him to bear. I
flew up Stairs, to advertise Mother, who
was half in and half out of her grogram
Gown, and who stayed me to clasp her
Owches; so that, by the Time I had followed
her down Stairs, we founde 'em
alreadie in the Hall.</p>

<p>So soon as I had kissed their Hands,
and obtayned their Blessings, the tall Lad
stept forthe, and who should he be but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<i>William Roper</i>, returned from my Father's
Errand over-seas! He hath grown hugelie,
and looks mannish; but his Manners
are worsened insteade of bettered by
forayn Travell; for, insteade of his old
Franknesse, he hung upon Hand till
<i>Father</i> bade him come forward; and
then, as he went his Rounds, kissing one
after another, stopt short when he came
to me, twice made as though he would
have saluted me, and then held back,
making me looke so stupid, that I could
have boxed his Ears for his Payns.
'Speciallie as <i>Father</i> burst out a-laughing,
and cried, "The third Time's lucky!"</p>

<p>After Supper, we took deare <i>Erasmus</i>
entirely over the House, in a Kind of
family Procession, e'en from the Buttery
and Scalding-house to our own deare
<i>Academia</i>, with its cool green Curtain
flapping in the Evening Breeze, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
blowing aside, as though on Purpose
to give a glimpse of the cleare-shining
<i>Thames</i>! <i>Erasmus</i> noted and admired
the Stone Jar, placed by <i>Mercy Giggs</i> on
the Table, full of blue and yellow Irises,
scarlet Tiger-Lilies, Dog-Roses, Honeysuckles,
Moonwort, and Herb-Trinity;
and alsoe our various Desks, eache in its
own little Retirement,&mdash;mine own, in
speciall, so pleasantly situate! He protested,
with everie Semblance of Sincerity,
he had never seene so pretty an Academy.
I should think not, indeede! <i>Bess</i>, <i>Daisy</i>,
and I, are of Opinion, that there is not
likelie to be such another in the World.
He glanced, too, at the Books on our
Desks; <i>Bessy's</i> being <i>Livy</i>; <i>Daisy's</i>, <i>Sallust</i>;
and mine, St. <i>Augustine</i>, with <i>Father's</i>
Marks where I was to read, and where desist.
He tolde <i>Erasmus</i>, laying his Hand
fondlie on my Head, "Here is one who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
knows what is implied in the Word
Trust." Dear <i>Father</i>, well I may! He
added, "there was no Law against laughing
in <i>his Academia</i>, for that his Girls
knew how to be merry and wise."</p>

<p>From the House to the new Building,
the Chapel and Gallery, and thence to
visitt all the dumb Kinde, from the great
horned Owls to <i>Cecy's</i> pet Dormice. <i>Erasmus</i>
was amused at some of theire Names,
but doubted whether <i>Duns Scotus</i> and
the <i>Venerable Bede</i> would have thoughte
themselves complimented in being made
Name-fathers to a couple of Owls; though
he admitted that <i>Argus</i> and <i>Juno</i> were
goode Cognomens for Peacocks. <i>Will
Roper</i> hath broughte Mother a pretty
little forayn Animal called a Marmot, but
she sayd she had noe Time for suchlike
Playthings, and bade him give it to his
little Wife. Methinks, I being neare sixteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and he close upon twenty, we are too
old for those childish Names now, nor am
I much flattered at a Present not intended
for me; however, I shall be kind to the
little Creature, and, perhaps, grow fond of
it, as 'tis both harmlesse and diverting.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>To return, howbeit, to <i>Erasmus</i>; <i>Cecy</i>,
who had hold of his Gown, and had
alreadie, through his familiar Kindnesse
and her own childish Heedlessness, somewhat
transgrest Bounds, began now in her
Mirthe to fabricate a Dialogue, she pretended
to have overhearde, between <i>Argus</i>
and <i>Juno</i> as they stoode pearcht on a
stone Parapet. <i>Erasmus</i> was entertayned
with her Garrulitie for a while, but at
length gentlie checkt her, with "Love
the Truth, little Mayd, love the Truth,
or, if thou liest, let it be with a Circumstance,"
a Qualification which made
<i>Mother</i> stare and <i>Father</i> laugh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>Sayth <i>Erasmus</i>, "There is no Harm in a
Fabella, Apologus, or Parabola, so long
as its Character be distinctlie recognised
for such, but contrariwise, much Goode;
and the same hath been sanctioned, not
only by the wiser Heads of <i>Greece</i> and
<i>Rome</i>, but by our deare Lord Himself.
Therefore, <i>Cecilie</i>, whom I love exceedinglie,
be not abasht, Child, at my Reproof,
for thy Dialogue between the
two Peacocks was innocent no less than
ingenious, till thou wouldst have insisted
that they, in sooth, sayd Something like
what thou didst invent. Therein thou
didst Violence to the Truth, which St.
<i>Paul</i> hath typified by a Girdle, to be
worn next the Heart, and that not only
confineth within due Limits, but addeth
Strength. So now be Friends; wert
thou more than eleven and I no Priest,
thou shouldst be my little Wife, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
darn my Hose, and make me sweet
Marchpane, such as thou and I love.
But, oh! this pretty <i>Chelsea</i>! What
Daisies! what Buttercups! what joviall
Swarms of Gnats! The Country all
about is as nice and flat as <i>Rotterdam</i>."</p>

<p>Anon, we sit down to rest and talk in
the Pavilion.</p>

<p>Sayth <i>Erasmus</i> to my <i>Father</i>, "I marvel
you have never entered into the
King's Service in some publick Capacitie,
wherein your Learning and Knowledge,
bothe of Men and Things, would
not onlie serve your own Interest, but
that of your Friends and the Publick."</p>

<p><i>Father</i> smiled and made Answer, "I
am better and happier as I am. As
for my Friends, I alreadie do for them
alle I can, soe as they can hardlie consider
me in their Debt; and, for myself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the yielding to theire Solicitations
that I would putt myself forward for
the Benefit of the World in generall,
would be like printing a Book at
Request of Friends, that the Publick
may be charmed with what, in Fact,
it values at a Doit. The Cardinall
offered me a Pension, as retaining Fee
to the King a little while back, but
I tolde him I did not care to be a
mathematical Point, to have Position
without Magnitude."</p>

<p><i>Erasmus</i> laught and sayd, "I woulde
not have you the Slave of anie King;
howbeit, you mighte assist him and
be useful to him."</p>

<p>"The Change of the Word," sayth
<i>Father</i>, "does not alter the Matter; I
should <i>be</i> a Slave, as completely as if
I had a Collar rounde my Neck."</p>

<p>"But would not increased Usefulnesse,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
says <i>Erasmus</i>, "make you happier?"</p>

<p>"Happier?" says <i>Father</i>, somewhat
heating; "how can that be compassed
in a Way so abhorrent to my Genius?
At present, I live as I will, to which
very few Courtiers can pretend. Half-a-dozen
blue-coated Serving-Men answer
my Turn in the House, Garden, Field,
and on the River: I have a few strong
Horses for Work, none for Show, plenty
of plain Food for a healthy Family,
and enough, with a hearty Welcome, for
a score of Guests that are not dainty.
The lengthe of my Wife's Train infringeth
not the Statute; and, for myself,
I soe hate Bravery, that my Motto
is, 'Of those whom you see in Scarlet,
not one is happy.' I have a regular
Profession, which supports my House,
and enables me to promote Peace and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Justice; I have Leisure to chat with
my Wife, and sport with my Children;
I have Hours for Devotion, and Hours
for Philosophie and the liberall Arts,
which are absolutelie medicinall to me,
as Antidotes to the sharpe but contracted
Habitts of Mind engendered by
the Law. If there be aniething in a
Court Life which can compensate for
the Losse of anie of these Blessings,
deare <i>Desiderius</i>, pray tell me what it
is, for I confesse I know not."</p>

<p>"You are a comicall Genius," says
<i>Erasmus</i>.</p>

<p>"As for you," retorted <i>Father</i>, "you
are at your olde Trick of arguing on
the wrong Side, as you did the firste
Time we mett. Nay, don't we know
you can declaime backward and forwarde
on the same Argument, as you
did on the <i>Venetian</i> War?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Erasmus</i> smiled quietlie, and sayd,
"What coulde I do? The <i>Pope</i> changed
his holy Mind." Whereat <i>Father</i> smiled
too.</p>

<p>"What Nonsense you learned Men
sometimes talk!" pursues <i>Father</i>. "I&mdash;wanted
at Court, quotha! Fancy a
dozen starving Men with one roasted
Pig betweene them;&mdash;do you think
they would be really glad to see a
Thirteenth come up, with an eye to a
small Piece of the Crackling? No;
believe me, there is none that Courtiers
are more sincerelie respectfull to than
the Man who avows he hath no Intention
of attempting to go Shares;
and e'en him they care mighty little
about, for they love none with true
Tendernesse save themselves."</p>

<p>"We shall see you at Court yet," says
<i>Erasmus</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>Sayth <i>Father</i>, "Then I will tell you
in what Guise. With a Fool's Cap
and Bells. Pish! I won't aggravate
you, Churchman as you are, by alluding
to the Blessings I have which you
have not; and I trow there is as much
Danger in taking you for serious when
you are onlie playful and ironicall as
if you were <i>Plato</i> himself."</p>

<p>Sayth <i>Erasmus</i>, after some Minutes'
Silence, "I know full well that you holde
<i>Plato</i>, in manie Instances, to be sporting
when I accept him in very Deed
and Truth. <i>Speculating</i> he often was;
as a brighte, pure Flame must needs
be struggling up, and, if it findeth no
direct Vent, come forthe of the Oven's
Mouth. He was like a Man shut into
a Vault, running hither and thither,
with his poor, flickering Taper, agonizing
to get forthe, and holding himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in readinesse to make a Spring forward
the Moment a Door should open. But
it never did. 'Not manie Wise are
called.' He had clomb a Hill in the
Darke, and stoode calling to his Companions
below, 'Come on, come on! this
Way lies the East; I am avised we
shall see the Sun rise anon.' But they
never did. What a Christian he woulde
have made! Ah! he is one now. He
and <i>Socrates</i>&mdash;the Veil long removed
from their Eyes&mdash;are sitting at <i>Jesus'</i>
Feet. <i>Sancte Socrates, ora pro nobis!</i>"</p>

<p><i>Bessie</i> and I exchanged Glances at this
so strange Ejaculation; but the Subjeckt
was of such Interest, that we listened with
deep Attention to what followed.</p>

<p>Sayth <i>Father</i>, "Whether <i>Socrates</i> were
what <i>Plato</i> painted him in his Dialogues,
is with me a great Matter of
Doubte; but it is not of Moment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
When so many Contemporaries coulde
distinguishe the fancifulle from the fictitious,
<i>Plato's</i> Object could never have
beene to <i>deceive</i>. There is something
higher in Art than gross Imitation. He
who attempteth it is always the leaste
successfull; and his Failure hath the
Odium of a discovered Lie; whereas,
to give an avowedlie fabulous Narrative
a Consistence within itselfe which permitts
the Reader to be, for the Time,
voluntarilie deceived, is as artfulle as it
is allowable. Were I to construct a
Tale, I woulde, as you sayd to <i>Cecy</i>, lie
with a Circumstance, but shoulde consider
it noe Compliment to have my
Unicorns and Hippogriffs taken for live
Animals. <i>Amicus Plato, amicus Socrates,
magis tamen amica Veritas.</i> Now, <i>Plato</i>
had a much higher Aim than to give a
very Pattern of <i>Socrates</i> his snub Nose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
He wanted a Peg to hang his Thoughts
upon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A Peg? A Statue by <i>Phidias</i>," interrupts
<i>Erasmus</i>.</p>

<p>"A Statue by <i>Phidias</i>, to clothe in the
most beautiful Drapery," sayth <i>Father</i>;
"no Matter that the Drapery was his
own, he wanted to show it to the best
Advantage, and to the Honour rather
than Prejudice of the Statue. And,
having clothed the same, he got a Spark
of <i>Prometheus</i> his Fire, and made the
aforesayd Statue walk and talk, to the
Glory of Gods and Men, and sate himself
quietlie down in a Corner. By the
Way, <i>Desiderius</i>, why shouldst thou not
submitt thy Subtletie to the Rules of
a Colloquy? Set <i>Eckius</i> and <i>Martin
Luther</i> by the Ears! Ha! Man, what
Sport! Heavens! if I were to compound
a Tale or a Dialogue, what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Crotchets and Quips of mine own
woulde I not putt into my Puppets'
Mouths! and then have out my Laugh
behind my Vizard, as when we used to
act Burlesques before <i>Cardinall Morton</i>.
What rare Sporte we had, one Christmas,
with a Mummery we called the
'Triall of Feasting'! <i>Dinner</i> and <i>Supper</i>
were broughte up before my <i>Lord Chief
Justice</i>, charged with Murder. Theire
Accomplices were <i>Plum-pudding</i>, <i>Mince-pye</i>,
<i>Surfeit</i>, <i>Drunkenness</i>, and suchlike.
Being condemned to hang by the Neck,
I, who was <i>Supper</i>, stuft out with I
cannot tell you how manie Pillows,
began to call lustilie for a Confessor,
and, on his stepping forthe, commenct
a List of all the Fitts, Convulsions,
Spasms, Payns in the Head, and so
forthe, I had inflicted on this one and
t'other. 'Alas! good Father,' says I,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
'<i>King John</i> layd his Death at my Door;&mdash;indeede,
there's scarce a royall or
noble House that hath not a Charge
agaynst me; and I'm sorelie afrayd'
(giving a Poke at a fat Priest that sate
at my <i>Lord Cardinall's</i> Elbow) 'I shall
have the Death of <i>that</i> holy Man to
answer for.'"</p>

<p><i>Erasmus</i> laughed, and sayd, "Did I
ever tell you of the retort of <i>Willibald
Pirkheimer</i>? A Monk, hearing him
praise me somewhat lavishly to another,
could not avoid expressing by his Looks
great Disgust and Dissatisfaction; and,
on being askt whence they arose, confest
he could not, with Patience, heare
the Commendation of a Man soe notoriously
fond of eating Fowls. 'Does he
steal them?' says <i>Pirkheimer</i>. 'Surely
no,' says the Monk. 'Why, then,'
quoth <i>Willibald</i>, 'I know of a Fox who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is ten times the greater Rogue; for,
look you, he helps himself to many a
fat Hen from my Roost without ever
offering to pay me. But tell me now,
dear Father, is it then a Sin to eat
Fowls?' 'Most assuredlie it is,' says
the Monk, 'if you indulge in them to
Gluttony.' 'Ah! if, if!' quoth <i>Pirkheimer</i>.
'If stands stiff, as the <i>Lacedemonians</i>
told <i>Philip</i> of <i>Macedon</i>; and 'tis
not by eating Bread alone, my dear
Father, you have acquired that huge
Paunch of yours. I fancy, if all the fat
Fowls that have gone into it could raise
their Voices and cackle at once, they
woulde make Noise enow to drown
the Drums and Trumpets of an army.'
Well may <i>Luther</i> say," continued <i>Erasmus</i>,
laughing, "that theire fasting is easier
to them than our eating to us; seeing
that every Man Jack of them hath to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
his Evening Meal two Quarts of Beer,
a Quart of Wine, and as manie as he
can eat of Spice Cakes, the better to
relish his Drink. While I ... 'tis
true my Stomach is Lutheran, but my
Heart is Catholic; that's as Heaven
made me, and I'll be judged by you
alle, whether I am not as thin as a
Weasel."</p>

<p>'Twas now growing dusk, and <i>Cecy's</i>
tame Hares were just beginning to be
on the alert, skipping across our Path, as
we returned towards the House, jumping
over one another, and raysing 'emselves
on theire hind Legs to solicitt our Notice.
<i>Erasmus</i> was amused at theire Gambols,
and at our making them beg for Vine-tendrils;
and <i>Father</i> told him there was
hardlie a Member of the Householde
who had not a dumb Pet of some Sort.
"I encourage the Taste in them," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sayd, "not onlie because it fosters Humanitie
and affords harmlesse Recreation,
but because it promotes Habitts of Forethoughte
and Regularitie. No Child
or Servant of mine hath Liberty to
adopt a Pet which he is too lazy or
nice to attend to himself. A little
Management may enable even a young
Gentlewoman to do this, without soyling
her Hands; and to negleckt giving
them proper Food at proper Times
entayls a Disgrace of which everie one
of 'em would be ashamed. But, hark!
there is the Vesper-bell."</p>

<p>As we passed under a Pear-tree, <i>Erasmus</i>
told us, with much Drollerie, of a
Piece of boyish Mischief of his,&mdash;the
Theft of some Pears off a particular Tree,
the Fruit of which the Superior of his
Convent had meant to reserve to himself.
One Morning, <i>Erasmus</i> had climbed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Tree, and was feasting to his great Content,
when he was aware of the Superior
approaching to catch him in the Fact;
soe, quickly slid down to the Ground,
and made off in the opposite Direction,
limping as he went. The Malice of this
Act consisted in its being the Counterfeit
of the Gait of a poor lame Lay Brother,
who was, in fact, smartlie punisht for
<i>Erasmus</i> his Misdeede. Our Friend mentioned
this with a Kinde of Remorse,
and observed to my <i>Father</i>,&mdash;"Men laugh
at the Sins of young People and little
Children, as if they were little Sins;
albeit, the Robbery of an Apple or
Cherry-orchard is as much a breaking
of the Eighth Commandment as
the stealing of a Leg of Mutton from
a Butcher's Stall, and ofttimes with far
less Excuse. Our Church tells us, indeede,
of Venial Sins, such as the Theft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of an Apple or a Pin; but, I think,"
(looking hard at <i>Cecilie</i> and <i>Jack</i>,) "even
the youngest among us could tell how
much Sin and Sorrow was brought into
the World by stealing an Apple."</p>

<p>At Bedtime, <i>Bess</i> and I did agree in
wishing that alle learned Men were as
apt to unite Pleasure with Profit in theire
Talk as <i>Erasmus</i>. There be some that
can write after the Fashion of Paul, and
others preach like unto Apollos; but this,
methinketh, is scattering Seed by the Wayside,
like the Great Sower.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">'T</span>is singular, the Love that
<i>Jack</i> and <i>Cecy</i> have for
one another; it resembleth
that of Twins.
<i>Jack</i> is not forward at
his Booke; on the other Hand, he hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a Resolution of Character which <i>Cecy</i>
altogether wants. Last Night, when
<i>Erasmus</i> spake of Children's Sins, I observed
her squeeze <i>Jack's</i> Hand with alle
her Mighte. I know what she was
thinking of. Having bothe beene forbidden
to approach a favourite Part of
the River Bank which had given way
from too much Use, one or the other of
'em transgressed, as was proven by the
smalle Footprints in the Mud, as well
as by a Nosegay of Flowers, that grow
not, save by the River; to wit, Purple
Loosestrife, Cream-and-codlins, Scorpion-grass,
Water Plantain, and the like.
Neither of 'em woulde confesse, and <i>Jack</i>
was, therefore, sentenced to be whipt.
As he walked off with Mr. <i>Drew</i>, I observed
<i>Cecy</i> turn soe pale, that I whispered
<i>Father</i> I was certayn she was guilty.
He made Answer, "Never mind, we cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
beat a Girl, and 'twill answer the
same Purpose; in flogging him, we flog
both." <i>Jack</i> bore the firste Stripe or
two, I suppose, well enow, but at lengthe
we hearde him cry out, on which <i>Cecy</i>
coulde not forbeare to doe the same, and
then stopt bothe her Ears. I expected
everie Moment to heare her say, "<i>Father</i>,
'twas I;" but no, she had not Courage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
for that; onlie, when <i>Jack</i> came forthe
all smirched with Tears, she put her
Arm about his Neck, and they walked
off together into the Nuttery. Since
that Hour, she hath beene more devoted
to him than ever, if possible; and he,
Boy-like, finds Satisfaction in making her
his little Slave. But the Beauty lay in
my <i>Father's</i> Improvement of the Circumstance.
Taking <i>Cecy</i> on his Knee that
Evening, (for she was not ostensiblie in
Disgrace,) he beganne to talk of Atonement
and Mediation for Sin, and who it
was that bare our Sins for us on the Tree.
'Tis thus he turns the daylie Accidents
of our quiet Lives into Lessons of deepe
Import, not pedanticallie delivered, <i>ex
cathedrÃ¢</i>, but welling forthe from a full
and fresh Mind.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="400" height="323"

</div>

<p>This Morn I had risen before Dawn,
being minded to meditate on sundrie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Matters before <i>Bess</i> was up and doing,
she being given to much Talk during
her dressing, and made my Way to the
Pavilion, where, methought, I should
be quiet enow; but beholde! <i>Father</i> and
<i>Erasmus</i> were there before me, in fluent
and earneste Discourse. I would have
withdrawne, but <i>Father</i>, without interrupting
his Sentence, puts his Arm rounde
me and draweth me to him; soe there I
sit, my Head on 's Shoulder, and mine
Eyes on <i>Erasmus</i> his Face.</p>

<p>From much they spake, and othermuch
I guessed, they had beene conversing on
the present State of the Church, and how
much it needed Renovation.</p>

<p><i>Erasmus</i> sayd, the Vices of the Clergy
and Ignorance of the Vulgar had now
come to a Poynt, at the which, a Remedie
must be founde, or the whole Fabric
would falle to Pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;Sayd, the Revival of Learning seemed
appoynted by Heaven for some greate Purpose,
'twas difficulte to say how greate.</p>

<p>&mdash;Spake of the new Art of Printing,
and its possible Consequents.</p>

<p>&mdash;Of the active and fertile Minds at
present turning up new Ground and ferreting
out old Abuses.</p>

<p>&mdash;Of the Abuse of Monachism, and of
the evil Lives of Conventualls. In special,
of the Fanaticism and Hypocrisie of the
Dominicans.</p>

<p>Considered the Evills of the Times
such, as that Societie must shortlie, by a
vigorous Effort, shake 'em off.</p>

<p>Wondered at the Patience of the Laitie
for soe many Generations, but thoughte
'em now waking from theire Sleepe. The
People had of late begunne to know theire
physickall Power, and to chafe at the
Weighte of theire Yoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Thoughte the Doctrine of Indulgences
altogether bad and false.</p>

<p><i>Father</i> sayd, that the graduallie increast
Severitie of Church Discipline concerning
minor Offences had become such as to
render Indulgences the needfulle Remedie
for Burthens too heavie to be borne.&mdash;Condemned
a Draconic Code, that visitted
even Sins of Discipline with the extream
Penaltie. Quoted how ill such excessive
Severitie answered in our owne Land,
with regard to the Civill Law; twenty
Thieves oft hanging together on the
same Gibbet, yet Robberie noe Whit
abated.</p>

<p>Othermuch to same Purport, the which,
if alle set downe, woulde too soon fill my
Libellus. At length, unwillinglie brake
off, when the Bell rang us to Matins.</p>

<p>At Breakfaste, <i>William</i> and <i>Rupert</i> were
earneste with my <i>Father</i> to let 'em row
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
him to <i>Westminster</i>, which he was disinclined
to, as he was for more Speede, and
had promised <i>Erasmus</i> an earlie Caste to
<i>Lambeth</i>; howbeit, he consented that they
should pull us up to <i>Putney</i> in the Evening,
and <i>William</i> should have the Stroke-oar.
<i>Erasmus</i> sayd, he must thank the
<i>Archbishop</i> for his Present of a Horse;
"tho' I'm full faine," he observed, "to
believe it a Changeling. He is idle and
gluttonish, as thin as a Wasp, and as
ugly as Sin. Such a Horse, and such a
Rider!"</p>

<p>In the Evening <i>Will</i> and <i>Rupert</i> had
made 'emselves spruce enow, with Nosegays
and Ribbons, and we tooke Water
bravelie;&mdash;<i>John Harris</i> in the Stern, playing
the Recorder. We had the six-oared
Barge; and when <i>Rupert Allington</i> was
tired of pulling, Mr. <i>Clement</i> tooke his
Oar; and when <i>he</i> wearied, <i>John Harris</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
gave over playing the Pipe; but <i>William</i>
and Mr. <i>Gunnel</i> never flagged.</p>

<p><i>Erasmus</i> was full of his Visitt to the
<i>Archbishop</i>, who, as usuall, I think, had
given him some Money.</p>

<p>"We sate down two hundred to
Table," sayth he; "there was Fish,
Flesh, and Fowl; but <i>Wareham</i> onlie
played with his Knife, and drank noe
Wine. He was very cheerfulle and
accessible; he knows not what Pride
is; and yet, of how much mighte he
be proude! What Genius! What Erudition!
what Kindnesse and Modesty!
From <i>Wareham</i>, who ever departed in
Sorrow?"</p>

<p>Landing at <i>Fulham</i>, we had a brave
Ramble thro' the Meadows. <i>Erasmus</i>,
noting the poor Children a gathering the
Dandelion and Milk-thistle for the Herb-market,
was avised to speak of forayn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Herbes and theire Uses, bothe for Food
and Medicine.</p>

<p>"For me," says <i>Father</i>, "there is manie
a Plant I entertayn in my Garden and
Paddock which the Fastidious woulde
caste forthe. I like to teache my Children
the Uses of common Things&mdash;to
know, for Instance, the Uses of the
Flowers and Weeds that grow in our
Fields and Hedges. Manie a poor
Knave's Pottage woulde be improved,
if he were skilled in the Properties of
the Burdock and Purple Orchis, Lady's-smock,
Brook-lime, and Old Man's
Pepper. The Roots of Wild Succory
and Water Arrow-head mighte agreeablie
change his Lenten Diet; and
Glasswort afford him a Pickle for his
Mouthfulle of Salt-meat. Then, there
are Cresses and Wood-sorrel to his
Breakfast, and Salep for his hot evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Mess. For his Medicine, there is
Herb-twopence, that will cure a hundred
Ills; Camomile, to lull a raging
Tooth; and the Juice of Buttercup to
cleare his Head by sneezing. Vervain
cureth Ague; and Crowfoot affords the
leaste painfulle of Blisters. St. <i>Anthony's</i>
Turnip is an Emetic; Goose-grass
sweetens the Blood; Woodruffe is good
for the Liver; and Bindweed hath nigh
as much Virtue as the forayn Scammony.
Pimpernel promoteth Laughter;
and Poppy, Sleep: Thyme giveth
pleasant Dreams; and an Ashen Branch
drives evil Spirits from the Pillow. As
for Rosemarie, I lett it run alle over
my Garden Walls, not onlie because my
Bees love it, but because 'tis the Herb
sacred to Remembrance, and, therefore,
to Friendship, whence a Sprig of it
hath a dumb Language that maketh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
it the chosen Emblem at our Funeral
Wakes, and in our Buriall Grounds.
Howbeit, I am a Schoolboy prating in
Presence of his Master, for here is <i>John
Clement</i> at my Elbow, who is the best
Botanist and Herbalist of us all."</p>

<p>&mdash;Returning Home, the Youths being
warmed with rowing, and in high Spiritts,
did entertayn themselves and us with
manie Jests and Playings upon Words,
some of 'em forced enow, yet provocative
of Laughing. Afterwards, Mr. <i>Gunnel</i>
proposed Enigmas and curious Questions.
Among others, he woulde know which
of the famous Women of Greece or
Rome we Maidens would resemble. <i>Bess</i>
was for <i>Cornelia</i>, <i>Daisy</i> for <i>Clelia</i>, but I
for <i>Damo</i>, Daughter of <i>Pythagoras</i>, which
<i>William Roper</i> deemed stupid enow, and
thoughte I mighte have found as good a
Daughter, that had not died a Maid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Sayth <i>Erasmus</i>, with his sweet, inexpressible
Smile, "Now I will tell you, Lads
and Lasses, what manner of Man <i>I</i> would
be, if I were not <i>Erasmus</i>. I woulde
step back some few Years of my Life,
and be half-way 'twixt thirty and forty;
I would be pious and profounde enow
for the Church, albeit noe Churchman;
I woulde have a blythe, stirring, English
Wife, and half-a-dozen merrie Girls
and Boys, an English Homestead, neither
Hall nor Farm, but betweene both;
neare enow to the Citie for Convenience,
but away from its Noise. I
woulde have a Profession, that gave me
some Hours daylie of regular Businesse,
that should let Men know my Parts,
and court me into Publick Station, for
which my Taste made me rather withdrawe.
I woulde have such a private
Independence, as should enable me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
give and lend, rather than beg and
borrow. I woulde encourage Mirthe
without Buffoonerie, Ease without
Negligence; my Habitt and Table
shoulde be simple, and for my Looks
I woulde be neither tall nor short, fat
nor lean, rubicund nor sallow, but of
a fayr Skin with blue Eyes, brownish
Beard, and a Countenance engaging and
attractive, soe that alle of my Companie
coulde not choose but love me."</p>

<p>"Why, then, you woulde be <i>Father</i>
himselfe," cries <i>Cecy</i>, clasping his Arm
in bothe her Hands with a Kind of Rapture;
and, indeede, the Portraiture was
soe like, we coulde not but smile at the
Resemblance.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Landing, <i>Father</i> protested
he was wearie with his Ramble;
and, his Foot slipping, he wrenched his
Ankle, and sate for an Instante on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Barrow, the which one of the Men had
left with his Garden-tools, and before he
could rise or cry out, <i>William</i>, laughing,
rolled him up to the House-door; which,
considering <i>Father's</i> Weight, was much
for a Stripling to doe. <i>Father</i> sayd the
same, and, laying his Hand on <i>Will's</i>
Shoulder with Kindnesse, cried, "Bless
thee, my Boy, but I woulde not have thee
overstrayned like <i>Biton</i> and <i>Cleobis</i>."</p>

his Morn, hinting to <i>Bess</i>
that she was lacing herselfe
too straitlie, she brisklie replyed,
"One would think
'twere as great Meritt to
have a thick Waiste as to be one of the
earlie Christians!"</p>

<p>These humourous Retorts are ever at
her Tongue's end; and albeit, as <i>Jacky</i>
one Day angrilie remarked when she had
beene teazing him, "<i>Bess</i>, thy Witt is
Stupidnesse;" yet, for one who talks
soe much at Random, no one can be more
keene when she chooseth. <i>Father</i> sayd of
her, half fondly, half apologeticallie, to
<i>Erasmus</i>, "Her Wit hath a fine Subtletie
that eludes you almoste before you have
Time to recognize it for what it really
is." To which <i>Erasmus</i> readilie assented,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
adding, that it had the rare Meritt of
playing less on Persons than Things, and
never on bodilie Defects.</p>

<p>Hum!&mdash;I wonder if they ever sayd as
much in Favour of me. I know, indeede,
<i>Erasmus</i> calls me a forward Girl. Alas!
that may be taken in two Senses.</p>

<p>Grievous Work, overnighte, with the
churning. Nought would persuade <i>Gillian</i>
but that the Creame was bewitched by
<i>Gammer Gurney</i>, who was dissatisfyde last
Friday with her Dole, and hobbled away
mumping and cursing. At alle Events,
the Butter would not come; but <i>Mother</i>
was resolute not to have soe much good
Creame wasted; soe sent for <i>Bess</i> and me,
<i>Daisy</i> and <i>Mercy Giggs</i>; and insisted on
our churning in turn till the Butter came,
if we sate up alle Night for 't. 'Twas a
hard Saying; and mighte have hampered
her like as <i>Jephtha</i> his rash Vow: howbeit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
soe soone as she had left us, we turned
it into a Frolick, and sang <i>Chevy Chase</i>
from end to end, to beguile Time; ne'erthelesse,
the Butter would not come; soe
then we grew sober, and, at the Instance
of sweete <i>Mercy</i>, chaunted the 119th
Psalme; and, by the Time we had
attained to "<i>Lucerna Pedibus</i>," I hearde
the Buttermilk separating and splashing in
righte earneste. 'Twas neare Midnighte,
however; and <i>Daisy</i> had fallen asleep on
the Dresser. <i>Gillian</i> will ne'er be convinced
but that our Latin brake the Spell.</p>

<p><i><span class="drop-cap-p">E</span>rasmus</i> went to <i>Richmond</i>
this Morning with <i>Polus</i>,
(for soe he Latinizes <i>Reginald
Pole</i>, after his usual
Fashion,) and some other
of his Friends. On his Return, he made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
us laugh at the following. They had
clomb the Hill, and were admiring the
Prospect, when <i>Pole</i>, casting his Eyes aloft,
and beginning to make sundrie Gesticulations,
exclaimed, "What is it I beholde?
May Heaven avert the Omen!" with
suchlike Exclamations, which raised the
Curiositie of alle. "Don't you beholde,"
cries he, "that enormous Dragon flying
through the Sky? his Horns of Fire?
his curly Tail?"</p>

<p>"No," says <i>Erasmus</i>, "nothing like it.
The Sky is as cleare as unwritten
Paper."</p>

<p>Howbeit, he continued to affirme and
to stare, untill at lengthe, one after another,
by dint of strayning theire Eyes and theire
Imaginations, did admitt, first, that they
saw Something; next, that it mighte be
a Dragon; and last, that it was. Of
course, on theire Passage homeward, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
could talk of little else&mdash;some made serious
Reflections; others, philosophicall Speculations;
and <i>Pole</i> waggishly triumphed in
having beene the Firste to discerne the
Spectacle.</p>

<p>"And you trulie believe there was a
Signe in the Heavens?" we inquired
of <i>Erasmus</i>.</p>

<p>"What know I?" returned he smiling;
"you know, <i>Constantine</i> saw a Cross.
Why shoulde <i>Polus</i> not see a Dragon?
We must judge by the Event. Perhaps
its Mission may be to fly away with
<i>him</i>. He swore to the curly Tail."</p>

<p>How difficulte it is to discerne the
supernatural from the incredible! We
laughe at <i>Gillian's</i> Faith in our Latin;
<i>Erasmus</i> laughs at <i>Polus</i> his Dragon.
Have we a righte to believe noughte but
what we can see or prove? Nay, that
will never doe. <i>Father</i> says a Capacitie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
for reasoning increaseth a Capacitie for
believing. He believes there is such a
Thing as Witchcraft, though not that
poore olde <i>Gammer Gurney</i> is a Witch;
he believes that Saints can work Miracles,
though not in alle the Marvels reported
of the <i>Canterbury</i> Shrine.</p>

<p>Had I beene Justice of the Peace, like
the King's Grandmother, I would have
beene very jealous of Accusations of
Witchcraft; and have taken infinite Payns
to sift out the Causes of Malice, Jealousie,
&amp;c., which mighte have wroughte with
the poore olde Women's Enemies. <i>Holie
Writ</i> sayth, "Thou shalt not suffer a
Witch to live;" but, questionlesse,
manie have suffered Hurte that were
noe Witches; and for my Part, I have
alwaies helde ducking to be a very uncertayn
as well as very cruel Teste.</p>

<p>I cannot helpe smiling, whenever I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
think of my Rencounter with <i>William</i> this
Morning. Mr. <i>Gunnell</i> had set me <i>Homer's</i>
tiresome List of Ships; and, because of
the excessive Heate within Doors, I took
my Book into the Nuttery, to be beyonde
the Wrath of far-darting <i>Ph&oelig;bus Apollo</i>,
where I clomb into my favourite Filbert
Seat. Anon comes <i>William</i> through the
Trees without seeing me; and seats
him at the Foot of my Filbert; then,
out with his Tablets, and, in a Posture
I should have called studdied, had
he known anie one within Sighte, falls
a poetizing, I question not. Having
noe Mind to be interrupted, I lett him
be, thinking he would soone exhaust the
Vein; but a Caterpillar dropping from
the Leaves on to my Page, I was fayn,
for Mirthe sake, to shake it down on his
Tablets. As ill Luck would have it, however,
the little Reptile onlie fell among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his Curls; which soe took me at Vantage
that I coulde not helpe hastilie crying,
"I beg your Pardon." 'Twas worth a
World to see his Start! "Why!" cries
he, looking up, "are there indeede <i>Hamadryads</i>?"
and would have gallanted
a little, but I bade him hold down his
Head, while that with a Twig I switched
off the Caterpillar. Neither coulde forbeare
laughing; and then he sued me to
step downe, but I was minded to abide
where I was. Howbeit, after a Minute's
Pause, he sayd, in a grave, kind Tone,
"Come, little Wife;" and taking mine Arm
steadilie in his Hand, I lost my Balance
and was faine to come down whether or
noe. We walked for some Time <i>juxta
Fluvium</i>; and he talked not badlie of his
Travels, insomuch as I founde there was
really more in him than one would think.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>&mdash;Was there ever Aniething soe perverse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
unluckie, and downrighte disagreeable?
We hurried our Afternoone Tasks,
to goe on the Water with my <i>Father</i>;
and, meaning to give Mr. <i>Gunnel</i> my
<i>Latin</i> Traduction, which is in a Booke
like unto this, I never knew he had my
Journalle insteade, untill that he burst
out a laughing. "Soe this is the famous
<i>Libellus</i>," quoth he.... I never waited
for another Word, but snatcht it out
of his Hand; which he, for soe strict a
Man, bore well enow. I do not believe
he could have read a Dozen Lines, and
they were towards the Beginning; but I
should hugelie like to know which Dozen
Lines they were.</p>

<p>Hum! I have a Mind never to write
another Word. That will be punishing
myselfe, though, insteade of <i>Gunnel</i>. And
he bade me not take it to Heart like the
late <i>Bishop of Durham</i>, to whom a like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Accident befel, which soe annoyed him
that he died of Chagrin. I will never
again, howbeit, write Aniething savouring
ever soe little of Levitie or Absurditie.
The Saints keepe me to it! And, to
know it from my Exercise Book, I will
henceforthe bind a blue Ribbon round it.
Furthermore, I will knit the sayd Ribbon
in soe close a Knot, that it shall be worth
no one else's Payns to pick it out. Lastlie,
and for entire Securitie, I will carry the
Same in my Pouch, which will hold
bigger Matters than this.</p>

<i>Clement</i> tooke the Pistoller's
Place at the Reading-desk;
and, insteade of continuing
the Subject in Hand, read
a Paraphrase of the 103rde Psalm; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Faithfulnesse and elegant Turne of which,
<i>Erasmus</i> highlie commended, though he
took Exceptions to the Phrase "renewing
thy Youth like that of the Ph&oelig;nix,"
whose fabulous Story he believed to have
beene unknowne to the Psalmist, and,
therefore, however poeticall, unfitt to be
introduced. A deepe Blush on sweet
<i>Mercy's</i> Face ledd to the Detection of the
Paraphrast, and drew on her some deserved
Commendations. <i>Erasmus</i>, turning
to my <i>Father</i>, exclaymed with Animation,
"I woulde call this House the
Academy of <i>Plato</i>, were it not Injustice
to compare it to a Place where the
usuall Disputations concerning Figures
and Numbers were onlie occasionallie
intersperst with Disquisitions concerning
the moral Virtues." Then, in a graver
Mood, he added, "One mighte envie you,
but that your precious Privileges are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
bound up with soe paynfulle Anxieties.
How manie Pledges have you given to
Fortune!"</p>

<p>"If my Children are to die out of the
Course of Nature, before theire Parents,"
<i>Father</i> firmly replyed, "I would rather
they died well-instructed than ignorant."</p>

<p>"You remind me," rejoyns <i>Erasmus</i>,
"of <i>Phocion</i>; whose Wife, when he was
aboute to drink the fatal Cup, exclaimed,
'Ah, my Husband! you die
innocent.' 'And woulde you, my
Wife,' he returned, 'have me die
guilty?'"</p>

<p>Awhile after, <i>Gonellus</i> askt leave to see
<i>Erasmus</i> his Signet-ring, which he handed
down to him. In passing it back, <i>William</i>,
who was occupyde in carving a Crane,
handed it so negligentlie that it felle to
the Ground. I never saw such a Face
as <i>Erasmus</i> made, when 'twas picked out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
from the Rushes! And yet, ours are renewed
almost daylie, which manie think
over nice. He took it gingerlie in his
faire, Woman-like Hands, and washed
and wiped it before he put it on; which
escaped not my Step-mother's displeased
notice. Indeede, these <i>Dutchmen</i> are
scrupulouslie cleane, though <i>Mother</i> calls
'em swinish, because they will eat raw
Sallets; though, for that Matter, <i>Father</i>
loves Cresses and Ramps. She alsoe mislikes
<i>Erasmus</i> for eating Cheese and Butter
together with his Manchet; or what he
calls <i>Boetram</i>; and for being, generallie,
daintie at his Sizes, which she sayth is an
ill Example to soe manie young People,
and becometh not one with soe little
Money in 's Purse: howbeit, I think 'tis
not Nicetie, but a weak Stomach, which
makes him loathe our Salt-meat Commons
from Michaelmasse to Easter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
eschew Fish of the coarser Sort. He
cannot breakfaste on colde Milk, like
<i>Father</i>, but liketh Furmity a little spiced.
At Dinner, he pecks at, rather than eats,
Ruffs and Reeves, Lapwings, or anie
smalle Birds it may chance; but affects
Sweets and Subtilties, and loves a Cup
of Wine or Ale, stirred with Rosemary.
<i>Father</i> never toucheth the Wine-cup but
to grace a Guest, and loves Water from
the Spring. We growing Girls eat more
than either; and <i>Father</i> says he loves to
see us slice away at the Cob-loaf; it does
him goode. What a kind Father he is!
I wish my <i>Step-mother</i> were as kind. I
hate all sneaping and snubbing, flowting,
fleering, pinching, nipping, and such-like;
it onlie creates Resentment insteade of
Penitence, and lowers the Minde of either
Partie. <i>Gillian</i> throws a Rolling-pin at
the Turnspit's Head, and we call it Low-life;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
but we looke for such Unmannerlinesse
in the Kitchen. A Whip is onlie
fit for <i>Tisiphone</i>.</p>

<p>As we rose from Table, I noted <i>Argus</i>
pearcht on the Window-sill, eagerlie
watching for his Dinner, which he looketh
for as punctuallie as if he could tell the
Diall; and to please the good, patient
Bird, till the Scullion broughte him his
Mess of Garden-stuff, I fetched him some
Pulse, which he took from mine Hand,
taking good Heede not to hurt me with
his sharp Beak. While I was feeding
him, <i>Erasmus</i> came up, and asked me
concerning <i>Mercy Giggs</i>; and I tolde him
how that she was a friendlesse Orphan,
to whom deare <i>Father</i> afforded Protection
and the run of the House; and tolde
him of her Gratitude, her Meekness, her
Patience, her Docilitie, her Aptitude for
alle goode Works and Alms-deeds; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
how, in her little Chamber, she improved
eache spare Moment in the Way of Studdy
and Prayer. He repeated "Friendlesse?
she cannot be called Friendlesse, who
hath <i>More</i> for her Protector, and his
Children for Companions;" and then
woulde heare more of her Parents' sad
Story. Alsoe, would hear somewhat of
<i>Rupert Allington</i>, and how <i>Father</i> gained
his Lawsuit. Alsoe, of <i>Daisy</i>, whose
Name he tooke to be the true Abbreviation
for <i>Margaret</i>, but I tolde him how
that my Step-sister, and <i>Mercy</i>, and I,
being all three of a Name, and I being
alwaies called <i>Meg</i>, we had in Sport given
one the Significative of her characteristic
Virtue, and the other that of the French
<i>Marguerite</i>, which may indeed be rendered
either Pearl or Daisy. And <i>Chaucer</i>,
speaking of our English Daisy, saith</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">S</span>ince the little Wisdom I
have Capacitie to acquire,
soe oft gives me the
Headache to Distraction,
I marvel not at <i>Jupiter's</i>
Payn in his Head, when the Goddess of
Wisdom sprang therefrom full growne.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This Morn, to quiet the Payn brought
on by too busie Application, Mr. <i>Gunnel</i>
would have me close my Book and ramble
forth with <i>Cecy</i> into the Fields. We
strolled towards <i>Walham Greene</i>; and she
was seeking for Shepherd's Purses and
Shepherd's Needles, when she came running
back to me, looking rather pale. I
askt what had scared her, and she made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
answer that <i>Gammer Gurney</i> was coming
along the Hedge. I bade her set aside
her Feares; and anon we came up with
<i>Gammer</i>, who was pulling at the purple
Blossoms of the Deadly Nightshade. I
sayd, "<i>Gammer</i>, to what Purpose gather
that Weed? knowest not 'tis Evill?"</p>

<p>She sayth, mumbling, "What <span class="smcap">God</span>
hath created, that call not thou evill."</p>

<p>"Well, but," quo' I, "'tis Poison."</p>

<p>"Aye, and Medicine too," returns
<i>Gammer</i>. "I wonder what we poor Souls
might come to, if we tooke Nowt for
our Ails and Aches but what we could
buy o' the Potticary. We've got noe
Dr. <i>Clement</i>, we poor Folks, to be our
Leech o' the Household."</p>

<p>"But hast no Feare," quo' I, "of an
Over-dose?"</p>

<p>"There's manie a Doctor," sayth she,
with an unpleasant Leer, "that hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
given that at first. In Time he gets
his Hand in; and I've had a Plenty o'
Practice&mdash;Thanks to Self and Sister."</p>

<p>"I knew not," quoth I, "that thou
hadst a Sister."</p>

<p>"How should ye, Mistress," returns she
shortlie, "when ye never comes nigh us?
We've grubbed on together this many
a Year."</p>

<p>"'Tis soe far," I returned, half ashamed.</p>

<p>"Why, soe it be," answers <i>Gammer</i>;
"far from Neighbours, far from Church,
and far from Priest; howbeit, my old
Legs carries me to <i>your</i> House o'
Fridays; but I know not whether I
shall e'er come agayn&mdash;the Rye Bread
was soe hard last Time; it may serve
for young Teeth, and for them as
has got none; but mine, you see, are
onlie on the <i>goe</i>;" and she opened her
Mouth with a ghastly Smile. "'Tis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not," she added, "that I'm ungratefulle;
but thou sees, Mistress, I really
<i>can't</i> eat Crusts."</p>

<p>After a Moment, I asked, "Where lies
your Dwelling?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>"Out by yonder," quoth she, pointing
to a shapeless Mass like a huge Bird's
Nest in the Corner of the Field. "There
bides poor <i>Joan</i> and I. Wilt come and
looke within, Mistress, and see how a
Christian can die?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>I mutelie complyed, in spite of <i>Cecy's</i>
pulling at my Skirts. Arrived at the
wretched Abode, which had a Hole for
its Chimney, and another for Door at
once and Window, I found, sitting in a
Corner, propped on a Heap of Rushes,
dried Leaves, and olde Rags, an aged sick
Woman, who seemed to have but a little
While to live. A Mug of Water stoode
within her Reach; I saw none other
Sustenance; but, in her Visage, oh, such
Peace!... Whispers <i>Gammer</i> with an
awfulle Look, "She sees 'em now!"</p>

<p>"Sees who?" quoth I.</p>

<p>"Why, Angels in two long Rows, afore
the Throne of <span class="smcap">God</span>, a bending of themselves,
this Way, with theire Faces to
th' Earth, and Arms stretched out afore
'em."</p>

<p>"Hath she seen a Priest?" quoth I.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lord</span> love ye," returns <i>Gammer</i>, "what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
coulde a Priest doe for her? She's in
Heaven alreadie. I doubte if she can
heare me." And then, in a loud, distinct
Voyce, quite free from her usuall
Mumping, she beganne to recite in <i>English</i>,
"Blessed is every one that feareth
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and walketh in his Ways,"
etc.; which the dying Woman hearde,
although alreadie speechlesse; and reaching
out her feeble Arm unto her Sister's
Neck, she dragged it down till their Faces
touched; and then, looking up, pointed
at Somewhat she aimed to make her see
... and we alle looked up, but saw
Noughte. Howbeit, she pointed up three
severall Times, and lay, as it were, transfigured
before us, a gazing at some transporting
Sighte, and ever and anon turning
on her Sister Looks of Love; and, the
While we stoode thus agaze, her Spiritt
passed away without even a Thrill or a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Shudder. <i>Cecy</i> and I beganne to weepe;
and, after a While, soe did <i>Gammer</i>;
then, putting us forthe, she sayd, "Goe,
Children, goe; 'tis noe goode crying;
and yet I'm thankfulle to ye for your
Teares."</p>

<p>I sayd, "Is there Aught we can doe
for thee?"</p>

<p>She made Answer, "Perhaps you can
give me Tuppence, Mistress, to lay on
her poor Eyelids and keep 'em down.
Bless 'ee, bless 'ee! You're like the
good Samaritan&mdash;he pulled out Twopence.
And maybe, if I come to 'ee
To-morrow, you'll give me a Lapfulle
of Rosemarie, to lay on her poor Corpse....
I know you've Plenty. <span class="smcap">God</span> be
with 'ee, Children; and be sure ye
mind how a Christian can die."</p>

<p>Soe we left, and came Home sober
enow. <i>Cecy</i> sayth, "To die is not soe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
fearfulle, <i>Meg</i>, as I thoughte, but shoulde
<i>you</i> fancy dying without a Priest? I
shoulde not; and yet <i>Gammer</i> sayd she
wanted not one. Howbeit, for certayn,
<i>Gammer Gurney</i> is noe Witch, or she
would not soe prayse <span class="smcap">God</span>."</p>

<p>To conclude, <i>Father</i>, on hearing Alle,
hath given <i>Gammer</i> more than enow for
her present Needes; and <i>Cecy</i> and I are
the Almoners of his Mercy.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">Y</span>esternighte, being
<i>St. John's Eve</i>, we went
into Town to see the
mustering of the Watch.
Mr. <i>Rastall</i> had secured
us a Window opposite the <i>King's Head</i>,
in <i>Chepe</i>, where theire Majestys went in
State to see the Show. The Streets were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
a Marvell to see, being like unto a
Continuation of fayr Bowres or Arbours,
garlanded acrosse and over the Doors
with greene Birch, long Fennel, Orpin,
St. <i>John's</i> Wort, white Lilies, and such
like; with innumerable Candles intersperst,
the which, being lit up as soon
as 'twas Dusk, made the Whole look
like enchanted Land; while, at the same
Time, the leaping over Bon-fires commenced,
and produced Shouts of Laughter.
The Youths woulde have had <i>Father</i> goe
downe and joyn 'em; <i>Rupert</i>, speciallie,
begged him hard, but he put him off
with, "Sirrah, you Goose-cap, dost think
'twoulde befitt the Judge of the <i>Sheriffs'
Court</i>?"</p>

<p>At length, to the Sound of Trumpets,
came marching up <i>Cheapside</i> two Thousand
of the Watch, in white Fustian,
with the City Badge; and seven hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Cressett Bearers, eache with his Fellow
to supplie him with Oyl, and making,
with theire flaring Lights, the Night as
cleare as Daye. After 'em, the Morris-dancers
and City Waites; the Lord Mayor
on horseback, very fine, with his Giants
and Pageants; and the Sheriff and his
Watch, and <i>his</i> Giants and Pageants. The
Streets very uproarious on our way back
to the Barge, but the homeward Passage
delicious; the Nighte Ayre cool; and
the Stars shining brightly. <i>Father</i> and
<i>Erasmus</i> had some astronomick Talk;
howbeit, methoughte <i>Erasmus</i> less familiar
with the heavenlie Bodies than <i>Father</i> is.
Afterwards they spake of the King, but
not over-freelie, by reason of the Bargemen
overhearing. Thence, to the ever-vext
Question of <i>Martin Luther</i>, of whome
<i>Erasmus</i> spake in Terms of earneste, yet
qualifyde Prayse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"If <i>Luther</i> be innocent," quoth he, "I
woulde not run him down by a wicked
Faction; if he be in Error, I woulde
rather have him reclaymed than destroyed;
for this is most agreeable to
the Doctrine of our deare Lord and
Master, who woulde not bruise the
broken Reede, nor quenche the smoking
Flax." And much more to same
Purpose.</p>

<p>We younger Folks felle to choosing
our favourite Mottoes and Devices, in
which the Elders at length joyned us.
<i>Mother's</i> was loyal&mdash;"Cleave to the Crown
though it hang on a Bush." <i>Erasmus's</i>
pithie&mdash;"<i>Festina lente.</i>" <i>William</i> sayd he
was indebted for his to St. <i>Paul</i>&mdash;"I
seeke not yours, but you." For me, I
quoted one I had seene in an olde Countrie
Church, "<i>Mieux Ãªtre que paroÃ®tre</i>,"
which pleased <i>Father</i> and <i>Erasmus</i> much.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">P</span>oor <i>Erasmus</i> caughte colde
on the Water last Nighte,
and keeps House to-daye,
taking warm Possets. 'Tis
my Week of Housekeeping
under Mother's Guidance, and I never
had more Pleasure in it; delighting to
suit his Taste in sweete Things, which,
methinks, all Men like. I have enow of
Time left for Studdy, when alle's done.</p>

<p>He hathe beene the best Part of the
Morning in our Academia, looking over
Books and Manuscripts, taking Notes of
some, discoursing with Mr. <i>Gunnel</i> on
others; and, in some Sorte, interrupting
our Morning's Work; but how pleasantlie!
Besides, as <i>Father</i> sayth, "Varietie
is not always Interruption. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
which occasionallie lets and hinders our
accustomed Studdies, may prove to the
ingenious noe less profitable than theire
Studdies themselves."</p>

<p>They beganne with discussing the Pronunciation
of Latin and Greek, on which
<i>Erasmus</i> differeth much from us, though
he holds to our Pronunciation of the
<i>Theta</i>. Thence, to the absurde Partie of
the <i>Ciceronians</i> now in <i>Italie</i>, who will
admit noe Author save <i>Tully</i> to be read
nor quoted, nor any Word not in his
Writings to be used. Thence to the
Latinitie of the <i>Fathers</i>, of whose Style
he spake slightlie enow, but rated <i>Jerome</i>
above <i>Augustine</i>. At length, to his <i>Greek</i>
and <i>Latin Testament</i>, of late issued from
the Presse, and the incredible Labour it
hath cost him to make it as perfect as
possible: on this Subject he so warmed
that <i>Bess</i> and I listened with suspended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Breath. "May it please <span class="smcap">God</span>," sayth he,
knitting ferventlie his Hands, "to make
it a Blessing to all Christendom! I
look for noe other Reward. Scholars
and Believers yet unborn may have
Reason to thank, and yet may forget
<i>Erasmus</i>." He then went on to explain
to <i>Gunnel</i> what he had much felt in want
of, and hoped some Scholar might yet
undertake; to wit, a Sort of <i>Index Bibliorum</i>,
showing in how manie Passages of
Holy Writ occurreth anie given Word,
etc.; and he e'en proposed it to <i>Gunnel</i>,
saying 'twas onlie the Work of Patience
and Industry, and mighte be layd aside,
and resumed as Occasion offered, and
completed at Leisure, to the great Thankfullenesse
of Scholars. But <i>Gunnel</i> onlie
smiled and shooke his Head. Howbeit,
<i>Erasmus</i> set forth his Scheme soe playnlie,
that I, having a Pen in Hand, did privilie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
note down alle the Heads of the same,
thinking, if none else would undertake
it, why should not I? since Leisure and
Industrie were alone required, and since
'twoulde be soe acceptable to manie,
'speciallie to <i>Erasmus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">H</span>earde <i>Mother</i> say to <i>Barbara</i>,
"Be sure the Sirloin is
well basted for the King's
Physician;" which avised
me that Dr. <i>Linacre</i> was
expected. In Truth, he returned with
<i>Father</i> in the Barge; and they tooke a
Turn on the River Bank before sitting
down to Table. I noted them from my
Lattice; and anon, <i>Father</i>, beckoning me,
cries, "Child, bring out my favourite
Treatyse on Fisshynge, printed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<i>Wynkyn de Worde</i>; I must give the
Doctor my loved Passage."</p>

<p>Joyning 'em with the Booke, I found
<i>Father</i> telling him of the Roach, Dace,
Chub, Barbel, etc., we oft catch opposite
the Church; and hastilie turning over
the Leaves, he beginneth with Unction
to read the Passage ensuing, which I love
to the full as much as he:&mdash;</p>

<p>He observeth, if the Angler's Sport
shoulde fail him, "he at the best hathe
his holsom Walk and mery at his Ease,
a swete Ayre of the swete Savour of the
Meade of Flowers, that maketh him
hungry; he heareth the melodious Harmonie
of Fowles, he seeth the young
Swans, Herons, Ducks, Cotes, and manie
other Fowles, with theire Broods, which
me seemeth better than alle the Noise
of Hounds, Faukenors, and Fowlers can
make. And if the Angler take Fysshe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
then there is noe Man merrier than he
is in his Spryte." And, "Ye shall not
use this foresaid crafty Disporte for no
covetysnesse in the encreasing and sparing
of your Money onlie, but pryncipallie
for your Solace, and to cause the
Health of your Bodie, and speciallie of
your Soule, for when ye purpose to goe
on your Disportes of Fysshynge, ye will
not desire greatlie manie Persons with
you, which woulde lett you of your
Game. And thenne ye may serve <span class="smcap">God</span>
devoutlie, in saying affectuouslie your
customable Prayer; and thus doing, ye
shall eschew and voyd manie Vices."</p>

<p>"Angling is itselfe a Vice," cries <i>Erasmus</i>,
from the Thresholde; "for my Part
I will fish none, save and except for
pickled Oysters."</p>

<p>"In the Regions below," answers
<i>Father</i>; and then laughinglie tells <i>Linacre</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of his firste Dialogue with <i>Erasmus</i>, who
had beene feasting in my Lord Mayor's
Cellar:&mdash;"'Whence come you?' 'From
below.' 'What were they about there?'
'Eating live Oysters, and drinking out
of Leather Jacks.' 'Either you are
<i>Erasmus</i>,' etc. 'Either you are <i>More</i>
or Nothing.'"</p>

<p>"'Neither more nor less,' you should
have rejoyned," sayth the Doctor.</p>

<p>"How I wish I had!" says <i>Father</i>;
"don't torment me with a Jest I might
have made and did not make; 'speciallie
to put downe <i>Erasmus</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Concedo nulli</i>," sayth <i>Erasmus</i>.</p>

<p>"Why are you so lazy?" asks <i>Linacre</i>;
"I am sure you can speak English if you
will."</p>

<p>"Soe far from it," sayth <i>Erasmus</i>, "that
I made my Incapacitie an Excuse for
declining an English Rectory. Albeit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
you know how <i>Wareham</i> requited me;
saying, in his kind, generous Way, I
served the Church more by my Pen
than I coulde by preaching Sermons in
a countrie Village."</p>

<p>Sayth <i>Linacre</i>, "The Archbishop hath
made another Remark, as much to the
Purpose: to wit, that he has received
from you the Immortalitie which Emperors
and Kings cannot bestow."</p>

<p>"They cannot even bid a smoking
Sirloin retain its Heat an Hour after
it hath left the Fire," sayth <i>Father</i>.
"Tilly-vally! as my good <i>Alice</i> says,&mdash;let
us remember the universal Doom,
'<i>Fruges consumere nati</i>,' and philosophize
over our Ale and Bracket."</p>

<p>"Not <i>Cambridge</i> Ale, neither," sayth
<i>Erasmus</i>.</p>

<p>"Will you never forget that unlucky
Beverage?" sayth <i>Father</i>. "Why, Man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
think how manie poor Scholars there
be, that content themselves, as I have
hearde one of St. <i>John's</i> declare, with a
penny piece of Beef amongst four, stewed
into Pottage with a little Salt and Oatmeal;
and that after fasting from four
o'clock in the Morning! Say Grace for
us this Daye, <i>Erasmus</i>, with goode Heart."</p>

<p>At Table, Discourse flowed soe thicke
and faste that I mighte aim in vayn to
chronicle it&mdash;and why should I? dwelling
as I doe at the Fountayn Head? Onlie
that I find Pleasure, alreadie, in glancing
over the foregoing Pages whensoever they
concern <i>Father</i> and <i>Erasmus</i>, and wish
they were more faithfullie recalled and
better writ. One Thing sticks by me,&mdash;a
funny Reply of <i>Father's</i> to a Man who
owed him Money and who put him off
with "<i>Memento Morieris</i>." "I bid you,"
retorted <i>Father</i>, "<i>Memento Mori Ã†ris</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
I wish you woulde take as goode Care to
provide for the one as I do for the other."</p>

<p><i>Linacre</i> laughed much at this, and sayd,&mdash;"That
was real Wit; a Spark struck
at the Moment; and with noe Ill-nature
in it, for I am sure your Debtor
coulde not help laughing."</p>

<p>"Not he," quoth <i>Erasmus</i>. "<i>More's</i>
Drollerie is like that of a young Gentlewoman
of his Name, which shines without
burning," ... and, oddlie enow,
he looked acrosse at <i>me</i>. I am sure he
meant <i>Bess</i>.</p>

He had beene to <i>Benmarine</i> and <i>TremeÃ§en</i>,
to the <i>Holie Citie</i> and to <i>Damascus</i>, to
<i>Urmia</i> and <i>Assyria</i>, and I think alle over
the knowne World; and tolde us manie
strange Tales, one hardlie knew how to
believe; as, for Example, of a Sea-coast
Tribe, called the <i>Balouches</i>, who live on
Fish and build theire Dwellings of the
Bones. Alsoe, of a Race of his Countriemen
beyond <i>Euphrates</i> who believe in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<i>Christ</i>, but know nothing of the Pope;
and of whom were the Magians that
followed the Star. This agreeth not with
our Legend. He averred that, though
soe far apart from theire Brethren, theire
Speech was the same, and even theire
Songs; and he sang or chaunted one
which he sayd was common among the
Jews alle over the World, and had beene
soe ever since theire Citie was ruinated
and the People captivated, and yet it was
never sett down in Prick-song. <i>Erasmus</i>,
who knows little or nought of Hebrew,
listened to the Words with Curiositie,
and made him repeate them twice or
thrice: and though I know not the
Character, it seemed to me they sounded
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Hay-field alle the Evening.
Swathed <i>Father</i> in a Hay-rope, and made
him pay the Fine, which he pretended
to resist. <i>Cecy</i> was just about to cast
one round <i>Erasmus</i>, when her Heart
failed and she ran away, colouring to
the Eyes. He sayd, he never saw such
pretty Shame. <i>Father</i> reclining on the
Hay, with his Head on my Lap and his
Eyes shut, <i>Bess</i> asked if he were asleep.
He made answer, "Yes, and dreaming."
I askt, "Of what?" "Of a far-off
future Daye, <i>Meg</i>; when thou and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
shall looke back on this Hour, and this
Hay-field, and my Head on thy Lap."</p>

<p>"Nay, but what a stupid Dream, Mr.
<i>More</i>," says <i>Mother</i>. "Why, what
woulde <i>you</i> dreame of, Mrs. <i>Alice</i>?"
"Forsooth, if I dreamed at alle, when I
was wide awake, it shoulde be of being
<i>Lord Chancellor</i> at the leaste." "Well,
Wife, I forgive thee for not saying at
the <i>most</i>. Lord Chancellor, quotha!
And you woulde be Dame <i>Alice</i>, I trow,
and ride in a Whirlecote, and keep a
Spanish Jennet, and a Couple of Greyhounds,
and wear a Train before and
behind, and carry a Jerfalcon on your
Fist." "On my Wrist." "No, that's
not such a pretty Word as t'other! Go
to, go!"</p>

<p>Straying from the others, to a remote
Corner of the Meadow, or ever I was
aware, I came close upon <i>Gammer Gurney</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
holding Somewhat with much Care.
"Give ye good den, Mistress <i>Meg</i>," quoth
she, "I cannot abear to rob the Birds of
theire Nests; but I knows you and
yours be kind to dumb Creatures, soe
here's a Nest o' young Owzels for ye&mdash;and
I can't call 'em dumb nowther, for
they'll sing bravelie some o' these Days."
"How hast fared, of late, <i>Gammer</i>?"
quoth I. "Why, well enow for such as
I," she made Answer; "since I lost the
Use o' my right Hand, I can nowther
spin, nor nurse sick Folk, but I pulls
Rushes, and that brings me a few Pence,
and I be a good Herbalist; onlie, because
I says one or two English Prayers,
and hates the Priests, some Folks thinks
me a Witch." "But why dost hate the
Priests?" quoth I. "Never you mind,"
she gave Answer, "I've Reasons manie;
and for my English Prayers, they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
taught me by a Gentleman I nursed,
that's now a Saint in Heaven, along
with poor <i>Joan</i>."</p>

<p>And soe she hobbled off, and I felt
kindlie towards her, I scarce knew why&mdash;perhaps
because she spake soe lovingly
of her dead Sister, and because of that
Sister's Name. <i>My</i> Mother's Name was
<i>Joan</i>.</p>

<p><i><span class="drop-cap-p">E</span>rasmus</i> is gone. His
last Saying to <i>Father</i> was,
"They will have you at
Court yet;" and <i>Father's</i>
Answer, "When <i>Plato's</i>
Year comes round."</p>

<p>To me he gave a Copy, how precious!
of his Testament. "You are an elegant
Latinist, <i>Margaret</i>," he was pleased to
say, "but, if you woulde drink deeplie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of the Well-springs of Wisdom, applie
to Greek. The Latins have onlie
shallow Rivulets; the Greeks, copious
Rivers, running over Sands of Gold.
Read <i>Plato</i>; he wrote on Marble, with
a Diamond; but above alle, read the
New Testament. 'Tis the Key to the
Kingdom of Heaven."</p>

<p>To Mr. <i>Gunnel</i>, he said smiling, "Have
a Care of thyself, dear <i>Gonellus</i>, and
take a little Wine for thy Stomach's
Sake. The Wages of most Scholars
now-a-days, are weak Eyes, Ill-health,
an empty Purse, and shorte Commons.
I neede only bid thee beware of the
two first."</p>

<p>To <i>Bess</i>, "Farewell, <i>Bessy</i>; thank you
for mending my bad Latin. When I
write to you, I will be sure to signe
myselfe, '<i>Roterodamius</i>.' Farewell, sweete
<i>Cecil</i>; let me always continue your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
'desired Amiable.' And you, <i>Jacky</i>,&mdash;love
your Book a little more."</p>

<p>"<i>Jack's</i> deare Mother, not content
with her Girls," sayth <i>Father</i>, "was
alwaies wishing for a Boy, and at last
she had one that means to remain a
Boy alle his Life."</p>

<p>"The Dutch Schoolmasters thoughte
<i>me</i> dulle and heavie," sayth <i>Erasmus</i>,
"soe there is some Hope of <i>Jacky</i> yet."
And soe, stepped into the Barge, which
we watched to <i>Chelsea Reach</i>. How dulle
the House has beene ever since! <i>Rupert</i>
and <i>William</i> have had me into the Pavillion
to hear the Plot of a Miracle-play
they have alreadie begunne to talke over
for <i>Christmasse</i>, but it seemed to me downrighte
Rubbish. <i>Father</i> sleepes in Town
to-nighte, soe we shall be stupid enow.
<i>Bessy</i> hath undertaken to work <i>Father</i> a
Slipper for his tender Foot; and is happie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
tracing for the Pattern our three Moorcocks
and Colts; but I am idle and
tiresome.</p>

<p>If I had Paper, I woulde beginne
my projected <i>Opus</i>; but I dare not ask
<i>Gunnel</i> for anie more just yet; nor have
anie Money to buy Some. I wish I had
a couple of Angels. I think I shall write
to <i>Father</i> for them to-morrow; he alwaies
likes to heare from us if he is twenty-four
Hours absent, providing we conclude not
with "I have Nothing more to say."</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">S</span>ixteenth Birthdaye.
<i>Father</i> away, which made
it sadde. <i>Mother</i> gave me
a payr of blue Hosen with
Silk Clocks; Mr. <i>Gunnel</i>,
an ivorie-handled Stylus; <i>Bess</i>, a Bodkin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
for my Hair; <i>Daisy</i>, a Book-mark; <i>Mercy</i>,
a Saffron Cake; <i>Jack</i>, a Basket; and
<i>Cecil</i>, a Nosegay. <i>William's</i> Present was
fayrest of alle, but I am hurte with him
and myselfe; for he offered it soe queerlie
and tagged it with such ... I refused
it, and there's an End. 'Twas unmannerlie
and unkinde of me, and I've cried
aboute it since.</p>

<p><i>Father</i> alwaies gives us a Birthdaye
Treat; soe, contrived that <i>Mother</i> shoulde
take us to see my <i>Lord Cardinal</i> of <i>York</i>
goe to <i>Westminster</i> in State. We had a
merrie Water-partie; got goode Places
and saw the Show; Crosse-bearers, Pillar-bearers,
Ushers and alle. Himselfe in
crimson engrayned Sattin, and Tippet
of Sables, with an Orange in his Hand
helde to 's Nose, as though the common
Ayr were too vile to breathe. What a
pompous Priest it is! The Archbishop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
mighte well say, "That Man is drunk
with too much Prosperitie."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Betweene Dinner and Supper, we had
a fine Skirmish in the Straits of ThermopylÃ¦.
Mr. <i>Gunnel</i> headed the Persians,
and <i>Will</i> was <i>Leonidas</i>, with a swashing
Buckler, and a Helmet a Yard high; but
Mr. <i>Gunnel</i> gave him such a Rap on the
Crest that it went over the Wall; soe
then <i>William</i> thought there was Nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
left for him but to die. Howbeit, as
he had beene layd low sooner than he
had reckoned on, he prolonged his last
Agonies a goode deal, and gave one of
the Persians a tremendous Kick just as
they were aboute to rifle his Pouch.
They therefore thoughte there must be
Somewhat in it they shoulde like to see;
soe, helde him down in spite of his
hitting righte and lefte, and pulled therefrom,
among sundrie lesser Matters, a
carnation Knot of mine. Poor Varlet, I
wish he would not be so stupid.</p>

<p>After Supper, <i>Mother</i> proposed a Concert;
and we were alle singing a Rounde,
when, looking up, I saw <i>Father</i> standing
in the Door-way, with such a happy
Smile on his Face! He was close behind
<i>Rupert</i> and <i>Daisy</i>, who were singing from
the same Book, and advertised them of
his Coming by gentlie knocking theire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Heads together; but I had the firste
Kiss, even before <i>Mother</i>, because of my

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">'T</span>is soe manie Months agone
since that I made an Entry
in my <i>Libellus</i>, as that my
Motto, "<i>Nulla Dies sine
Linea</i>," hath somewhat
of Sarcasm in it. How manie Things
doe I beginne and leave unfinisht! and
yet, less from Caprice than Lack of
Strength; like him of whom the Scripture
was writ,&mdash;"This Man beganne to
build and was not able to finish." My
<i>Opus</i>, for instance; the which my <i>Father's</i>
prolonged Absence in the Autumn, and
my Winter Visitt to Aunt <i>Nan</i> and Aunt
<i>Fan</i> gave me such Leisure to carrie
forward. But alack! Leisure was less
to seeke than Learninge; and when I
came back to mine olde Taskes, Leisure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
was awanting too; and then, by reason
of my sleeping in a separate Chamber,
I was enabled to steale Hours from the
earlie Morn and Hours from the Night,
and, like unto <i>Solomon's</i> virtuous Woman,
my Candle went not out. But 'twas not
to Purpose that I worked, like the virtuous
Woman, for I was following a Jack-o-Lantern;
having forsooke the straight
Path laid downe by <i>Erasmus</i> for a foolish
Path of mine owne; and soe I toyled,
and blundered, and puzzled, and was
mazed; and then came on that Payn
in my Head. <i>Father</i> sayd, "What makes
<i>Meg</i> soe pale?" and I sayd not: and,
at the last, I tolde <i>Mother</i> there was
somewhat throbbing and twisting in the
Back of mine Head, like unto a little
Worm that woulde not die; and she made
Answer, "Ah, a Maggot," and soe by
her Scoff I was shamed. Then I gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
over mine <i>Opus</i>, but the Payn did not
yet goe; soe then I was longing for
the deare Pleasure, and fondlie turning
over the Leaves, and wondering woulde
<i>Father</i> be surprised and pleased with it
some Daye, when <i>Father</i> himself came
in or ever I was aware. He sayth,
"What hast thou, <i>Meg</i>?" I faltered and
woulde sett it aside. He sayth, "Nay,
let me see;" and soe takes it from
me; and after the firste Glance throws
himself into a Seat, his Back to me,
and firste runs it hastilie through, then
beginnes with Methode and such Silence
and Gravitie as that I trembled at his
Side, and felt what it must be to stand
a Prisoner at the Bar, and he the Judge.
Sometimes I thought he must be pleased,
at others not: at lengthe, alle my fond
Hopes were ended by his crying, "This
will never doe. Poor Wretch, hath this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
then beene thy Toyl? How couldst
find Time for soe much Labour? for
here hath beene Trouble enow and to
spare. Thou must have stolen it, sweet
<i>Meg</i>, from the Night, and prevented
the Morning Watch. Most dear'st!
thy <i>Father's</i> owne loved Child;" and
soe, caressing me till I gave over my
Shame and Disappointment.</p>

<p>"I neede not to tell thee, <i>Meg</i>," <i>Father</i>
sayth, "of the unprofitable Labour of
<i>Sisyphus</i>, nor of drawing Water in a
Sieve. There are some Things, most
deare one, that a Woman, if she trieth,
may doe as well as a Man; and some
she cannot, and some she had better
not. Now, I tell thee firmlie, since
the firste Payn is the leaste sharpe, that,
despite the Spiritt and Genius herein
shewn, I am avised 'tis Work thou
canst not and Work thou hadst better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
not doe. But judge for thyselfe; if
thou wilt persist, thou shalt have Leisure
and Quiet, and a Chamber in my new
Building, and alle the Help my Gallery
of Books may afford. But thy Father
says, Forbear."</p>

<p>Soe, what coulde I say, but "My
Father shall never speak to me in vayn."</p>

<p>Then he gathered the Papers up and
sayd, "Then I shall take Temptation out
of your Way;" and pressing 'em to his
Heart as he did soe, sayth, "They are as
deare to me as they can be to you;"
and soe left me, looking out as though I
noted (but I noted not) the cleare-shining
<i>Thames</i>. 'Twas Twilighte, and I stoode
there I know not how long, alone and
lonely; with Tears coming, I knew not
why, into mine Eyes. There was a
Weight in the Ayr, as of coming Thunder;
the Screaming, ever and anon, of <i>Juno</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and <i>Argus</i>, inclined me to Mellancholie,
as it alwaies does: and at length I beganne
to note the Moon rising, and the
deepening Clearnesse of the Water, and
the lazy Motion of the Barges, and the
Flashes of Light whene'er the Rowers
dipt theire Oars. And then I beganne to
attend to the Cries and different Sounds
from acrosse the Water, and the Tolling
of a distant Bell; and I felle back on
mine olde heart-sighinge, "<i>Fecisti nos ad
te, Domine; et inquietum est cor nostrum,
donec requiescat in te</i>."</p>

<p>Or ever the Week was gone, my Father
had contrived for me another Journey to
<i>New Hall</i>, to abide with the Lay Nuns,
as he calleth them, Aunt <i>Nan</i> and Aunt
<i>Fan</i>, whom my Step-mother loveth not,
but whom I love and whom <i>Father</i> loveth.
Indeede, 'tis sayd in <i>Essex</i> that at first he
inclined to Aunt <i>Nan</i> rather than to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Mother; but that, perceiving my Mother
affected his Companie and Aunt <i>Nan</i>
affected it not, he diverted his hesitating
Affections unto her and took her to wife.
Howbeit, Aunt <i>Nan</i> loveth him dearlie
as a Sister ought: indeed, she loveth alle,
except, methinketh, herself, to whom,
alone, she is rigid and severe. How holie
are my Aunts' Lives! Cloistered Nuns
could not be more pure, and could scarce
be as usefulle. Though wise, they can
be gay; though noe longer young, they
love the Young. And theire Reward is,
the Young love them; and I am fulle
sure in this World they seek noe better.</p>

<p>Returned to <i>Chelsea</i>, I spake much in
Prayse of mine Aunts, and of single Life.
On a certayn Evening, we Maids were
sett at our Needles and Samplers on the
Pavilion Steps; and, as Follie will out,
'gan talk of what we would fayn have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
our Lots, shoulde a good Fairie starte up
and grant eache a Wish. <i>Daisy</i> was for
a Countess's Degree, with Hawks and
Hounds. <i>Bess</i> was for founding a College,
<i>Mercy</i> a Hospital, and she spake soe
experimentallie of its Conditions that I
was fayn to goe Partners with her in the
same. <i>Cecy</i> commenced, "Supposing I
were married; if once that I were married"&mdash;on
which, <i>Father</i>, who had come
up unperceived, burst out laughing and
sayth, "Well, Dame <i>Cecily</i>, and what
State would you keep?" Howbeit, as
he and I afterwards paced together, <i>juxta
Fluvium</i>, he did say, "<i>Mercy</i> hath well
propounded the Conditions of an Hospital
or Alms-house for aged and sick
Folk, and 'tis a Fantasie of mine to sett
even such an one afoot, and give you
the Conduct of the same."</p>

<p>From this careless Speech, dropped as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
'twere by the Way, hath sprung mine
House of Refuge! and oh, what Pleasure
have I derived from it! How good is
my Father! how the Poor bless him!
and how kind is he, through them, to
me! Laying his Hand kindly on my
Shoulder, this Morning, he sayd, "<i>Meg</i>,
how fares it with thee now? Have I
cured the Payn in thy Head?" Then,
putting the House-key into mine Hand,
he laughingly added, "'Tis now yours,
my Joy, by <i>Livery</i> and <i>Seisin</i>."</p>

the Men playing
at Loggats, <i>Father</i> and I
strayed away along <i>ThermopylÃ¦</i>
into the Home-field;
and as we sauntered together under
the Elms, he sayth with a Sigh, "<i>Jack</i>
is <i>Jack</i>, and no <i>More</i> ... he will
never be anything. An' 'twere not for

unhappy Father. But what though!&mdash;My
<i>Meg</i> is better unto me than ten
Sons; and it maketh no Difference at
Harvest-time whether our Corn were put

<p>While I was turning in my Mind what
Excuse I might make for <i>John</i>, <i>Father</i>
taketh me at unawares by a sudden Change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of Subject; saying, "Come, tell me, <i>Meg</i>,
why canst not affect <i>Will Roper</i>?"</p>

<p>I was a good while silent, at length
made Answer, "He is so unlike alle I
esteem and admire ... so unlike alle
I have been taught to esteem and admire
by you."&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have at you," he returned laughing,
"I wist not I had been sharpening
Weapons agaynst myself. True, he is
neither <i>Achilles</i> nor <i>Hector</i>, nor even
<i>Paris</i>, but yet well enough, meseems,
as Times go&mdash;smarter and comelier than
either <i>Heron</i> or <i>Dancey</i>."</p>

<p>I, faltering, made Answer, "Good Looks
affect me but little&mdash;'tis in his better
Part I feel the Want. He cannot ...
discourse, for instance, to one's Mind
and Soul, like unto you, dear <i>Father</i>, or
<i>Erasmus</i>."</p>

<p>"I should marvel if he could," returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<i>Father</i> gravelie, "thou art mad,
my Daughter, to look, in a Youth of
<i>Will's</i> Years, for the Mind of a Man
of fifty. What were <i>Erasmus</i> and I,
dost thou suppose, at <i>Will's</i> age? Alas,
<i>Meg</i>, I should not like you to know
what I was! Men called me the Boy-sage,
and I know not what, but in my
Heart and Head was a World of Sin
and Folly. Thou mightst as well expect
<i>Will</i> to have my Hair, Eyes, and
Teeth, alle getting the worse for Wear,
as to have the Fruits of my life-long
Experience, in some Cases full dearly
bought. Take him for what he is,
match him by the young Minds of his
owne standing: consider how long and
closelie we have known him. His Parts
are, surelie, not amiss: he hath more
Book-lore than <i>Dancey</i>, more mother
Wit than <i>Allington</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>"But why need I to concern myself
about him?" I exclaymed; "<i>Will</i> is
very well in his way: why should we
cross each other's Paths? I am young, I
have much to learn, I love my Studdies,&mdash;why
interrupt them with other and
less wise Thoughts?"</p>

<p>"Because nothing can be wise that is
not practical," returned <i>Father</i>, "and I
teach my Children Philosophie to fitt
them for living in the World, not above
it. One may spend a Life in dreaming
over <i>Plato</i>, and yet goe out of it
without leaving the World a whit the
better for our having made Part of it.
'Tis to little Purpose we studdy, if
it onlie makes us exact Perfections in
others which they may in vayn seek for
in ourselves. It is not even necessary or
goode for us to live entirelie with congeniall
Spiritts. The vigourous tempers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the inert, the passionate is evened by
the cool-tempered, the prosaic balances
the visionarie. Woulde thy Mother suit
me better, dost thou suppose, if she
coulde discuss Polemicks like <i>Luther</i> or
<i>Melancthon</i>? E'en thine owne sweet
Mother, <i>Meg</i>, was less affected to Studdy
than thou art,&mdash;she learnt to love it for
my Sake, but I made her what she was."</p>

<p>And, with a suddain Burste of fond Recollection,
he hid his Eyes on my Shoulder,
and for a Moment or soe, cried bitterlie.
As for me, I shed, oh! such salt Teares!...</p>

into <i>Mercy's</i> Chamber, I
founde her all be-wept and
waped, poring over an old
Kirtle of Mother's she had
bidden her re-line with Buckram. Coulde

not make out whether she were sick of
her Task, had had Words with Mother,
or had some secret Inquietation of her
owne; but, as she is a Girl of few
Words, I found I had best leave her
alone after a Caress and kind Saying or
two. We alle have our Troubles.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">T</span>rulie may I say soe.
Here have they ta'en a
Fever of some low Sorte
in my House of Refuge,
and <i>Mother</i>, fearing it may
be the Sicknesse, will not have me goe
neare it, lest I should bring it home.
<i>Mercy</i>, howbeit, hath besought her soe
earnestlie to let her goe and nurse the
Sick, that <i>Mother</i> hath granted her Prayer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
on Condition she returneth not till the
Fever bates ... thus setting her Life
at lower Value than our owne. Deare
<i>Mercy</i>! I would fayn be her Mate.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">W</span>e are alle mightie glad that
<i>Rupert Allington</i> hath at
lengthe zealouslie embraced
the Studdy of the Law.
'Twas much to be feared
at the Firste there was noe Application
in him, and though we alle pitied him
when <i>Father</i> first broughte him Home,
a pillaged, portionlesse Client, with none
other to espouse his Rightes, yet 'twas a
Pitie soone allied with Contempt when
we founde how emptie he was, caring for
nought but Archerie and Skittles and the
Popinjaye out o' the House, and Dicing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and Tables within, which <i>Father</i> would on
noe Excuse permitt. Soe he had to conform,
ruefullie enow, and hung piteouslie
on Hand for awhile. I mind me of <i>Bess's</i>
saying, about <i>Christmasse</i>, "Heaven send
us open Weather while <i>Allington</i> is here;
I don't believe he is one that will bear
shutting up." Howbeit, he seemed to
incline towards <i>Daisy</i>, who is handsome
enow, and cannot be hindered of Two-hundred
Pounds, and soe he kept within
Bounds, and when <i>Father</i> got him his
Cause he was mightilie thankfulle, and
woulde have left us out of Hand, but
<i>Father</i> persuaded him to let his Estate
recover itself, and turn the mean Time
to Profitt, and, in short, soe wrought on
him, that he hath now become a Student
in righte earneste.</p>

not only Mr. <i>Clement</i>, but
Mr. <i>Gunnel</i>! How sorrie
we alle are! It seemeth
he hath long been debating
for and agaynst the Church, and at length
finds his Mind soe stronglie set towards
it, as he can keep out of it noe longer.
Well! we shall lose a good Master, and
the Church will gayn a good Servant.
<i>Drew</i> will supplie his Place, that is,
according to his beste, but our worthy
Welshman careth soe little for young
People, and is soe abstract from the
World about him, that we shall oft
feel our Loss. <i>Father</i> hath promised

<p>I fell into Disgrace for holding Speech
with <i>Mercy</i> over the Pales, but she is
confident there is noe Danger; the Sick
are doing well, and none of the Whole
have fallen sick. She sayth <i>Gammer
Gurney</i> is as tender of her as if she
were her Daughter, and will let her doe
noe vile or paynfull Office, soe as she
hath little to doe but read and pray for
the poor Souls, and feed 'em with savourie
Messes, and they are alle so harmonious
and full of Cheer, as to be like Birds in

more than I. Were I a free Agent,
she should not be alone now, and I

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">B</span>usied with my Flowers
the chief o' the Forenoon,
I was fayn to rest in the
Pavilion, when, entering
therein, whom shoulde I
stumble upon but <i>William</i>, layd at length
on the Floor, with his Arms under his
Head, and his Book on the Ground. I
was withdrawing brisklie enow, when he
called out, "Don't goe away, since you
<i>are</i> here," in a Tone soe rough, soe
unlike his usuall Key, as that I paused
in a Maze, and then saw that his Eyes
were red. He sprung to his Feet and
sayd, "<i>Meg</i>, come and talk to me;" and,
taking my Hand in his, stepped quicklie
forthe without another Word sayd, till
we reached the Elm-tree Walk. I marvelled
to see him soe moven, and expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to hear Somewhat that shoulde displease
me, scarce knowing what; however, I
might have guest at it from then till
now, without ever nearing the Truth.
His first Words were, "I wish <i>Erasmus</i>
had ne'er crost the Thresholde; he has
made me very unhappie;" then, seeing
me stare, "Be not his Council just now,
deare <i>Meg</i>, but bind up, if thou canst,
the Wounds he has made.... There
be some Wounds, thou knowest, though
but of a cut Finger or the like, that
we cannot well bind up for ourselves."</p>

<p>I made Answer, "I am a young and
unskilled Leech."</p>

<p>He replyed, "But you have a quick
Wit, and Patience, and Kindnesse, and for
a Woman, are not scant of Learning."</p>

<p>"Nay," I sayd, "but Mr. <i>Gunnel</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Gunnel</i> would be the Last to help
me," interrupts <i>Will</i>, "nor can I speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to your Father. He is alwaies too
busie now ... besides,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father <i>Francis</i>?" I put in.</p>

<p>"Father <i>Francis</i>?" repeats <i>Will</i>, with
a Shake o' the Head and a ruefulle Smile;
"dost thou think, <i>Meg</i>, he coulde answer
me if I put to him <i>Pilate's</i> Question,
'What is Truth?'"</p>

<p>"We know alreadie," quoth I.</p>

<p>Sayth <i>Will</i>, "What do we know?"</p>

<p>I paused, then made Answer reverentlie,
"That <i>Jesus</i> is the Way, the Truth, and
the Life."</p>

<p>"Yes," he exclaymed, clapping his
Hands together in a strange Sort of
Passion; "that we <i>doe</i> know, blessed be
<span class="smcap">God</span>, and other Foundation can or ought
noe Man to lay than that is layd, which
is <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>. But, <i>Meg</i>, is this the
Principle of our Church?"</p>

<p>"Yea, verily," I steadfastlie replied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then, how has it beene overlayd,"
he hurriedlie went on, "with Men's Inventions!
St. <i>Paul</i> speaks of a Sacrifice
once offered: we holde the Host to be
a continuall Sacrifice. Holy Writ telleth
us, where a Tree falls it must lie; we are
taughte that our Prayers may free Souls
from Purgatorie. The Word sayth, 'By
Faith ye are saved;' the Church sayth,
we may be saved by our Works. It is
written, 'The Idols he shall utterly
abolish;' we worship Figures of Gold
and Silver...." "Hold, hold," I sayd,
"I dare not listen to this.... You are
wrong, you know you are wrong."</p>

<p>"How and where?" he sayth; "onlie
tell me. I long to be put righte."</p>

<p>"Our Images are but Symbols of our
Saints," I made Answer; "'tis onlie the
Ignorant and Unlearned that worship
the mere Wood and Stone."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>"But why worship Saints at alle?"
persisted <i>Will</i>; "where's your Warrant
for it?"</p>

<p>I sayd, "Heaven has warranted it by
sundrie and speciall Miracles at divers
Times and Places. I may say to you,
<i>Will</i>, as <i>Socrates</i> to <i>Agathon</i>, 'You may
easilie argue agaynst me, but you cannot
argue agaynst the Truth.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, put me not off with <i>Plato</i>," he
impatientlie replyed, "refer me but to
Holie Writ."</p>

<p>"How can I," quoth I, "when you
have ta'en away my Testament ere I had
half gone through it? 'Tis this Book,
I fear me, poor <i>Will</i>, hath unsettled
thee. Our Church, indeed, sayth the Unlearned
wrest it to theire Destruction."</p>

<p>"And yet the Apostle sayth," rejoyned
<i>Will</i>, "that it contayns alle Things necessarie
to our Salvation."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>"Doubtlesse it doth, if we knew but
where to find them," I replied.</p>

<p>"And how find, unlesse we seeke?"
he pursued, "and how know which Road
to take, when we find the Scripture
and the Church at Issue?"</p>

<p>"Get some wiser Head to advise us,"
I rejoyned.</p>

<p>"But an' if the Obstacle remains the
same?"</p>

<p>"I cannot suppose that," I somewhat
impatientlie returned, "<span class="smcap">God's</span> Word and
<span class="smcap">God's</span> Church must agree; 'tis only we
that make them at Issue."</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>Meg</i>, that is just such an Answer
as Father <i>Francis</i> mighte give&mdash;it solves
noe Difficultie. If, to alle human Reason,
they pull opposite Ways, by which
shall we abide? I know; I am certain.
'<i>Tu, Domine Jesu, es Justicia mea!</i>'"</p>

<p>He looked soe rapt, with claspt Hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and upraysed Eyes, as that I coulde not
but look on him and hear him with
Solemnitie. At length I sayd, "If you
know and are certayn, you have noe
longer anie Doubts for me to lay, and
with your Will, we will holde this Discourse
noe longer, for however moving
and however considerable its Subject
Matter may be, it approaches forbidden
Ground too nearlie for me to feel it
safe, and I question whether it savoureth
not of Heresie. However, <i>Will</i>, I most
heartilie pitie you, and will pray for
you."</p>

<p>"Do, <i>Meg</i>, do," he replyed, "and say
nought to any one of this Matter."</p>

<p>"Indeede I shall not, for I think
'twoulde bring you if not me into
Trouble; but, since thou haste soughte
my Council, <i>Will</i>, receive it now and
take it...."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p>He sayth, "What is it?"</p>

<p>"To read less, pray more, fast, and use
such Discipline as our Church recommends,
and I question not this Temptation
will depart. Make a fayr Triall."</p>

<p>And soe, away from him, though he
woulde fain have sayd more; and I have
kept mine own Worde of praying for
him full earnestlie, for it pitieth me to
see him in such Case.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Man's Table, came not in till late, on
Plea of Businesse. My Lord tolde him
the King had visitted him not long agone,
and was soe well content with his Manor
as to wish it were his owne, for the
singular fine Ayr and pleasant growth of
Wood. In fine, wound up the Evening
with Musick. My Lady hath a Pair of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fine-toned Clavichords, and a Mandoline
that stands five Feet high; the largest
in <i>England</i>, except that of the Lady <i>Mary

but methinketh the Instrument ungaynlie
for a Woman. Lord <i>Sands</i> sang us a new
Ballad, "<i>The King's Hunt's up</i>," which

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">S</span>ayth Lord <i>Rutland</i> to
my Father, in his acute
sneering Way, "Ah, ah,
Sir <i>Thomas</i>, <i>Honores mutant
Mores</i>."</p>

<p>"Not so, in Faith, my Lord," returns
<i>Father</i>, "but have a care lest we translate
the Proverb, and say Honours change
<i>Manners</i>."</p>

<p>It served him right, and the Jest is
worth preserving, because 'twas not premeditate,
as my Lord's very likely was,
but retorted at once and in Self-defence.
I don't believe Honours <i>have</i> changed
the <i>Mores</i>. As <i>Father</i> told <i>Mother</i>, there's
the same Face under the Hood. 'Tis
comique, too, the Fulfilment of <i>Erasmus</i>
his Prophecy. <i>Plato's</i> Year has not come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
rounde, but they have got <i>Father</i> to
Court, and the King seems minded never
to let him goe. For us, we have the
same untamed Spiritts and unconstrayned
Course of Life as ever, neither lett nor
hindered in our daylie Studdies, though
we dress somewhat braver, and see more
Companie. <i>Mother's</i> Head was a little
turned, at first, by the Change and Enlargement
of the Householde ... the
Acquisition of Clerk of the Kitchen,
Surveyor of the Dresser, Yeoman of the
Pastrie, etc., but, as <i>Father</i> laughinglie
tolde her, the Increase of her Cares soon
steddied her Witts, for she found she had
twenty Unthrifts to look after insteade of
half-a-dozen. And the same with himself.
His Responsibilities are soe increast,
that he grutches at everie Hour the Court
steals from his Family, and vows, now
and then, he will leave off joking, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the King may the sooner wearie of him.
But this is onlie in Jest, for he feels it
is a <i>Power</i> given him over lighter Minds,
which he may exert to usefull and high
Purpose. Onlie it keepeth him from
needing <i>Damocles</i> his Sword; he trusts
not in the Favour of Princes nor in the
Voyce of the People, and keeps his Soul
as a weaned Child. 'Tis much for us
now to get an Hour's Leisure with him,
and makes us feel what our olde Privilleges
were when we knew 'em not. Still, I'm
pleased without being over elated, at his
having risen to his proper Level.</p>

<p>The <i>King</i> tooke us by Surprise this
Morning: <i>Mother</i> had scarce time to
slip on her Scarlett Gown and Coif, ere
he was in the House. His Grace was
mighty pleasant to all, and, at going,
saluted all round, which <i>Bessy</i> took
humourously, <i>Daisy</i> immoveablie, <i>Mercy</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
humblie, I distastefullie, and <i>Mother</i> delightedlie.
She calls him a fine Man;
he is indeede big enough, and like to
become too big; with long slits of Eyes
that gaze freelie on all, as who shoulde
say, "Who dare let or hinder us?" His
Brow betokens Sense and Franknesse, his
Eyebrows are supercilious, and his Cheeks
puffy. A rolling, straddling Gait, and
abrupt Speech.</p>

<p>T'other Evening, as <i>Father</i> and I were,
unwontedly, strolling together down the
Lane, there accosts us a shabby poor Fellow,
with something unsettled in his Eye....</p>

<p>"Master, Sir Knight, and may it please
your Judgeship, my name is <i>Patteson</i>."</p>

<p>"Very likely," says <i>Father</i>, "and my
Name is <i>More</i>, but what is that to the
Purpose?"</p>

<p>"And that is <i>more</i> to the Purpose, you
mighte have said," returned the other.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, soe I mighte," says <i>Father</i>,
"but how shoulde I have proved it?"</p>

<p>"You who are a Lawyer shoulde
know best about that," rejoyned the
poor Knave; "'tis too hard for poor
<i>Patteson</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, but who are you?" says <i>Father</i>,
"and what do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"Don't you mind me?" says <i>Patteson</i>;
"I played Hold-your-tongue, last <i>Christmasse</i>
Revel was five Years, and they
called me a smart Chap then, but last
<i>Martinmasse</i> I fell from the Church
Steeple, and shook my Brain-pan, I
think, for its Contents have seemed
addled ever since; soe what I want
now is to be made a Fool."</p>

<p>"Then you are not one already?" says
<i>Father</i>.</p>

<p>"If I were," says <i>Patteson</i>, "I shoulde
not have come to <i>you</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, Like cleaves to Like, you
know they say," says <i>Father</i>.</p>

<p>"Aye," says t'other, "but I've Reason
and Feeling enow, too, to know you
are no Fool, though I thoughte you
might want one. Great People like
'em at their Tables, I've hearde say,
though I am sure I can't guesse why, for
it makes me sad to see Fools laughed
at; ne'erthelesse, as I get laughed at
alreadie, methinketh I may as well get
paid for the Job if I can, being unable,
now, to doe a Stroke of Work in hot
Weather. And I'm the onlie Son of
my Mother, and she is a Widow. But
perhaps I'm not bad enough."</p>

<p>"I know not that, poor Knave," says
<i>Father</i>, touched with quick Pity, "and,
for those that laugh at Fools, my
Opinion, <i>Patteson</i>, is that they are the
greater Fools who laugh. To tell you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the Truth, I had had noe Mind to take
a Fool into mine Establishment, having
alwaies had a Fancy to be prime Fooler
in it myselfe; however, you incline me to
change my Purpose, for as I said anon,
Like cleaves to Like, soe, I'll tell you
what we will doe&mdash;divide the Businesse
and goe Halves&mdash;I continuing the Fooling,
and thou receiving the Salary; that
is, if I find, on Inquiry, thou art given to
noe Vice, including that of Scurrillitie."</p>

<p>"May it like your Goodness," says
poor <i>Patteson</i>, "I've been the Subject, oft,
of Scurrillitie, and affect it too little to
offend that Way myself. I ever keep
a civil Tongue in my Head, 'specially
among young Ladies."</p>

<p>"That minds me," says <i>Father</i>, "of a
Butler who sayd he always was sober,
especially when he only had Water to
drink. Can you read and write?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, and what if I cannot?" returns
<i>Patteson</i>, "there ne'er was but one, I
ever heard of, that knew Letters, never
having learnt, and well he might, for
he made them that made them."</p>

<p>"<i>Meg</i>, there is Sense in this poor
Fellow," says <i>Father</i>, "we will have
him Home and be kind to him."</p>

<p>And, sure enow, we have done so and
been so ever since.</p>

is the greater Man of the two."</p>

<p>"Why, Gossip," cries <i>Father</i>, "his
Grace woulde make two of me."</p>

<p>"Not a Bit of it," returns <i>Patteson</i>,
"he's big enow for two such as you are,
I grant ye, but the King can't make
two of you. No! Lords and Commons
may make a King, but a King can't
make a Sir <i>Thomas More</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, he can," rejoyns <i>Father</i>, "he can
make me Lord Chancellor, and then
he will make me more than I am
already; <i>ergo</i>, he will make Sir <i>Thomas</i>
more."</p>

<p>"But what I mean is," persists the
Fool, "that the King can't make such
another as you are, any more than all
the King's Horses and all the King's
Men can put <i>Humpty-dumpty</i> together
again, which is an ancient Riddle, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
full of Marrow. And soe he'll find,
if ever he lifts thy Head off from thy
Shoulders, which <span class="smcap">God</span> forbid!"</p>

<p><i>Father</i> delighteth in sparring with
<i>Patteson</i> far more than in jesting with
the King, whom he alwaies looks on as
a Lion that may, any Minute, fall on
him and rend him. Whereas, with
t'other, he ungirds his Mind. Their
Banter commonly exceeds not Pleasantrie,
but <i>Patteson</i> is ne'er without an Answer;
and although, maybe, each amuses himselfe
now and then with thinking, "I'll
put him up with such a Question,"
yet, once begun, the Skein runs off the
Reel without a Knot, and shews the
excellent Nature of both, soe free are
they alike from Malice and Over-license.
Sometimes theire Cuts are neater than
common Listeners apprehend. I've seene
<i>Rupert</i> and <i>Will</i>, in fencing, make theire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Swords flash in the Sun at every Parry
and Thrust; agayn, owing to some
Change in mine owne Position, or the
Decline of the Sun, the Scintillations
have escaped me, though I've known
their Rays must have been emitted in
some Quarter alle the same.</p>

<p><i>Patteson</i>, with one of <i>Argus's</i> cast
Feathers in his Hand, is at this Moment
beneath my Lattice, astride on a Stone
Balustrade; while <i>Bessy</i>, whom he much
affects, is sitting on the Steps, feeding her
Peacocks. Sayth <i>Patteson</i>, "Canst tell
me, Mistress, why Peacocks have soe
manie Eyes in theire Tails, and yet can
onlie see with two in theire Heads?"</p>

<p>"Because those two make them soe
vain alreadie, Fool," says <i>Bess</i>, "that
were they always beholding theire owne
Glory, they woulde be intolerable."</p>

<p>"And besides that," says <i>Patteson</i>, "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
less we see or heare, either, of what
passes behind our Backs, the better for
us, since Knaves will make Mouths
at us then, for as glorious as we may
be. Canst tell me, Mistress, why the
Peacock was the last Bird that went
into the Ark?"</p>

<p>"First tell me, Fool," returns <i>Bess</i>,
"how thou knowest that it was soe?"</p>

<p>"Nay, a Fool may ask a Question
would puzzle a Wiseard to answer,"
rejoyns <i>Patteson</i>; "I mighte ask you, for
example, where they got theire fresh
Kitchen-stuff in the Ark, or whether
the Birds ate other than Grains, or the
wild Beasts other than Flesh. It needs
must have been a Granary."</p>

<p>"We ne'er shew ourselves such Fools,"
says <i>Bess</i>, "as in seeking to know more
than is written. They had enough, if
none to spare, and we scarce can tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
how little is enough for bare Sustenance
in a State of perfect Inaction. If the
Creatures were kept low, they were all
the less fierce."</p>

<p>"Well answered, Mistress," says <i>Patteson</i>,
"but tell me, why do you wear two
Crosses?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Fool," returns <i>Bess</i>, "I wear
but one."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I say you wear two," says
<i>Patteson</i>, "one at your Girdle, and one
that nobody sees. We alle wear the
unseen one, you know. Some have
theirs of Gold, alle carven and shaped,
soe as you hardlie tell it for a Cross
... like my Lord Cardinall, for Instance
... but it is one, for alle that.
And others, of Iron, that eateth into
their Hearts ... methinketh Master
<i>Roper's</i> must be one of 'em. For me,
I'm content with one of Wood, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that our deare <span class="smcap">Lord</span> bore; what was
goode enow for him is goode enow for
me, and I've noe Temptation to shew
it, as it isn't fine, nor yet to chafe at it
for being rougher than my Neighbour's,
nor yet to make myself a second because
it is not hard enow. Doe you take me,
Mistress?"</p>

<p>"I take you for what you are," says
<i>Bess</i>, "a poor Fool."</p>

<p>"Nay, Niece," says <i>Patteson</i>, "my
Brother your Father hath made me
rich."</p>

<p>"I mean," says <i>Bess</i>, "you have more
Wisdom than Witt, and a real Fool
has neither, therefore you are only a
make-believe Fool."</p>

<p>"Well, there are many make-believe
Sages," says <i>Patteson</i>; "for mine owne
Part, I never aim to be thoughte a
<i>Hiccius Doccius</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<p>"A <i>hic est doctus</i>, Fool, you mean,"
interrupts <i>Bess</i>.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do," rejoins <i>Patteson</i>, "since
other Folks soe oft know better what
we mean than we know ourselves.
Alle I woulde say is, I ne'er set up for
a Conjuror. One can see as far into
a Millstone as other People, without
being that. For Example, when a Man
is overta'en with Qualms of Conscience
for having married his Brother's Widow,
when she is noe longer soe young and
fair as she was a Score of Years ago,
we know what that's a Sign of. And
when an <i>Ipswich</i> Butcher's Son takes
on him the State of my Lord <i>Pope</i>, we
know what that's a Sign of. Nay, if
a young Gentlewoman become dainty
at her Sizes, and sluttish in her Apparel,
we ... as I live, here comes <i>Giles
Heron</i>, with a Fish in's Mouth."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>Poor Bess involuntarilie turned her
Head quicklie towards the Watergate;
on which, <i>Patteson</i>, laughing as he lay
on his Back, points upward with his
Peacock's Feather, and cries, "Overhead,
Mistress! see, there he goes. Sure, you
lookt not to see Master <i>Heron</i> making
towards us between the Posts and
Flower-pots, eating a dried Ling?"
laughing as wildly as though he were
verily a Natural.</p>

<p><i>Bess</i>, without a Word, shook the
Crumbs from her Lap, and was turning
into the House, when he withholds her
a Minute in a perfectly altered Fashion,
saying, "There be some Works, Mistress,
our Confessors tell us be Works of
Supererogation ... is not that the
Word? I learn a long one now and
then ... such as be setting Food
before a full Man, or singing to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
deaf one, or buying for one's Pigs a
Silver Trough, or, for the Matter of
that, casting Pearls before a Dunghill
Cock, or fishing for a Heron, which is
well able to fish for itself, and is an
ill-natured Bird after all, that pecks
the Hand of his Mistress, and, for all
her Kindness to him, will not think of
<i>Bessy More</i>."</p>

<p>How apt alle are to abuse unlimited
License! Yet 'twas good Counsel.</p>

<p><i><span class="drop-cap-p">F</span>ather</i> hath had some
Words with the Cardinall.
'Twas touching the Draught
of some forayn Treaty which
the Cardinall offered for
his Criticism, or rather, for his Commendation,
which <i>Father</i> could not give. This
nettled his Grace, who exclaimed,&mdash;"By
the Mass, thou art the veriest Fool of all
the Council." <i>Father</i>, smiling, rejoined,
"<span class="smcap">God</span> be thanked, that the King our
Master hath but one Fool therein."</p>

<p>The <i>Cardinall</i> may rage, but he can't
rob him of the royal Favour. The <i>King</i>
was here yesterday, and walked for an
Hour or soe about the Garden, with his
Arm round <i>Father's</i> Neck. <i>Will</i> coulde
not help felicitating <i>Father</i> upon it afterwards;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to which <i>Father</i> made Answer,
"I thank <span class="smcap">God</span> I find his Grace my very
good Lord indeed, and I believe he
doth as singularly favour me as any
Subject within this Realm. Howbeit,
son <i>Roper</i>, I may tell thee between
ourselves, I feel no Cause to be proud
thereof, for if my Head would win him
a Castle in <i>France</i>, it shoulde not fail
to fly off."</p>

<p>&mdash;<i>Father</i> is graver than he used to
be. No Wonder. He hath much on
his Mind; the Calls on his Time and
Thoughts are beyond Belief; but <span class="smcap">God</span> is
very good to him. His Favour at home
and abroad is immense: he hath good
Health, soe have we alle; and his Family
are established to his Mind, and settled
alle about him, still under the same
fostering Roof. Considering that I am
the most ordinarie of his Daughters, 'tis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
singular I should have secured the best
Husband. <i>Daisy</i> lives peaceablie with
<i>Rupert Allington</i>, and is as indifferent,
me seemeth, to him as to alle the
World beside. He, on his Part, loves her
and theire Children with Devotion, and
woulde pass half his Time in the Nurserie.
<i>Dancey</i> always had a hot Temper,
and now and then plagues <i>Bess</i>; but she
lets noe one know it but me. Sometimes
she comes into my Chamber and
cries a little, but the next kind Word
brightens her up, and I verilie believe
her Pleasures far exceed her Payns. <i>Giles
Heron</i> lost her through his own Fault, and
might have regained her good Opinion
after all, had he taken half the Pains for
her Sake he now takes for her younger
Sister: I cannot think how <i>Cecy</i> can favour
him; yet I suspect he will win her, sooner
or later. As to mine own deare <i>Will</i>, 'tis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the kindest, purest Nature, the finest Soul,
the ... and yet how I was senselesse
enow once to undervalue him!</p>

<p>Yes, I am a happy Wife; a happy
Daughter; a happy Mother. When my
little <i>Bill</i> stroaked dear <i>Father's</i> Face just
now, and murmured "Pretty!" he burst
out a-laughing, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are like the young <i>Cyrus</i>, who
exclaimed,&mdash;'Oh! Mother, how pretty
is my Grandfather!' And yet, according
to <i>Xenophon</i>, the old Gentleman was soe
rouged and made up, as that none but
a Child woulde have admired him!"</p>

<p>"That's not the Case," I observed,
"with <i>Bill's</i> Grandfather."</p>

<p>"He's a <i>More</i> all over," says <i>Father</i>,
fondly. "Make a Pun, <i>Meg</i>, if thou
canst, about <i>Amor</i>, <i>Amore</i>, or <i>Amores</i>.
'Twill onlie be the thousand and first
on our Name. Here, little Knave, see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
these Cherries: tell me who thou art,
and thou shalt have one. '<i>More!
More!</i>' I knew it, sweet Villain. Take
them all."</p>

<p>I oft sitt for an Hour or more, watching
<i>Hans Holbein</i> at his Brush. He hath a
rare Gift of limning; and has, besides, the
Advantage of deare <i>Erasmus</i> his Recommendation,
for whom he hath alreddie
painted our Likenesses, but I think he
has made us very ugly. His Portraiture
of my Grandfather is marvellous; ne'erthelesse,
I look in vayn for the Spirituallitie
which our <i>Lucchese</i> Friend, <i>Antonio
Bonvisi</i>, tells us is to be found in the
Productions of the Italian Schools.</p>

<p><i>Holbein</i> loves to paint with the Lighte
coming in upon his Work from above.
He says a Lighte from above puts Objects
in theire proper Lighte, and shews
theire just Proportions; a Lighte from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
beneath reverses alle the naturall Shadows.
Surelie, this hath some Truth if we spirituallize
it.</p>

<p><i><span class="drop-cap-p">R</span>upert's</i> Cousin, <i>Rosamond
Allington</i>, is our Guest.
She is as beautiful as ...
not as an Angel, for she
lacks the Look of Goodness,
but very beautiful indeed. She
cometh hither from <i>Hever Castle</i>, her
Account of the Affairs whereof I like
not. Mistress <i>Anne</i> is not there at present;
indeed, she is now always hanging
about Court, and followeth somewhat
too literallie the scriptural Injunction to
<i>Solomon's</i> Spouse&mdash;to forget her Father's
House. The <i>King</i> likes well enow to be
compared with <i>Solomon</i>, but Mistress <i>Anne</i>
is not his Spouse yet, nor ever will be,
I hope. Flattery and Frenchified Habitts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
have spoilt her, I trow.</p>

<p><i>Rosamond</i> says there is not a good
Chamber in the Castle; even the Ball-room,
which is on the upper Floor of
alle, being narrow and low. On a rainy
Day, long ago, she and Mistress <i>Anne</i>
were playing at Shuttlecock therein, when
<i>Rosamond's</i> Foot tripped at some Unevennesse
in the Floor, and Mistress <i>Anne</i>,
with a Laugh, cried out, "Mind you goe
not down into the Dungeon"&mdash;then
pulled up a Trap-door in the Ball-room
Floor, by an iron Ring, and made <i>Rosamond</i>
look down into an unknown Depth;
all in the blacknesse of Darkness. 'Tis
an awfulle Thing to have onlie a Step
from a Ball-room to a Dungeon! I'm
glad we live in a modern House; we
have noe such fearsome Sights here.</p>

Offence! This Morning <i>Father</i> and he
had a long, and, I fear me, fruitless Debate
in the Garden; on returning from
which, <i>Father</i> took me aside and sayd,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Meg</i>, I have borne a long Time with

argued with him, and still given him
my poor, fatherly Counsel; but I perceive
none of alle this can call him

unto this Saint and that,
methought, "Why not
applie unto the Fountain
Head? Maybe these
holie Spiritts may have Limitations sett
to the Power of theire Intercessions&mdash;at
anie Rate, the Ears of <i>Mary-mother</i> are
open to alle."</p>

<p>Soe I beganne, "<i>Eia mater, fons
amoris.</i>" ...</p>

<p>Then methoughte, "But I am onlie
asking <i>her</i> to intercede&mdash;I'll mount a
Step higher still." ...</p>

<p>Then I turned to the greate Intercessor
of alle. But methought, "Still he intercedes
with another, although the same.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
And his owne Saying was, 'In that Day
ye shall ask <i>me nothing</i>. Whatsoever ye
shall ask in my Name, <i>he</i> will give it
you.'" Soe I did.</p>

<p>I fancy I fell asleep with the Tears on
my Cheek. <i>Will</i> had not come up Stairs.
Then came a heavie, heavie Sleep, not
such as giveth Rest; and a dark, wild
Dream. Methought I was tired of waiting
for <i>Will</i>, and became alarmed. The
Night seemed a Month long, and at last
I grew soe weary of it, that I arose, put
on some Clothing, and went in search of
him whom my Soul loveth. Soon I
founde him, sitting in a Muse; and said,
"<i>Will</i>, deare <i>Will</i>?" but he hearde me
not; and, going up to touch him, I was
amazed to be broughte short up or ever
I reached him, by Something invisible
betwixt us, hard, and cleare, and colde,
... in short, a Wall of Ice! Soe it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
seemed, in my strange Dreame. I pushed
at it, but could not move it; called to
him, but coulde not make him hear: and
all the While my Breath, I suppose, raised
a Vapour on the glassy Substance, that
grew thicker and thicker, soe as slowlie
to hide him from me. I coulde discerne
his Head and Shoulders, but not see down
to his Heart. Then I shut mine Eyes
in Despair, and when I opened 'em, he
was hidden altogether.</p>

<p>Then I prayed. I put my hot Brow
agaynst the Ice, and I kept a weeping
hot Tears, and the warm Breath of Prayer
kept issuing from my Lips; and still I
was persisting, when, or ever I knew
how, the Ice beganne to melt! I felt it
giving Way! and, looking up, coulde in
joyfulle Surprize just discerne the Lineaments
of a Figure close at t'other Side;
the Face turned away, but yet in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Guise of listening. And, Images being apt
to seem magnified and distorted through
Vapours, methought 'twas altogether bigger
than <i>Will</i>, yet himself, nothingthelesse;
and, the Barrier between us having sunk
away to Breast-height, I layd mine Hand
on's Shoulder, and he turned his Head,
smiling, though in Silence; and ...
oh, Heaven! 'twas not <i>Will</i>, but&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>What coulde I doe, even in my Dreame,
but fall at his Feet? What coulde I doe,
waking, but the same? 'Twas Grey of
Morn; I was feverish and unrefreshed,
but I wanted noe more lying a-bed. <i>Will</i>
had arisen and gone forthe; and I, as
quicklie as I coulde make myself readie,
sped after him.</p>

<p>I know not what I expected, nor what
I meant to say. The Moment I opened
the Door of his Closett, I stopt short.
There he stoode, in the Centre of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Chamber; his Hand resting flat on an
open Book, his Head raised somewhat up,
his Eyes fixed on Something or some One,
as though in speaking Communion with
'em; his whole Visage lightened up and
glorifide with an unspeakable Calm and
Grandeur that seemed to transfigure him
before me; and, when he hearde my Step,
he turned about, and 'steade of histing
me away, helde out his Arms.... We
parted without neede to utter a Word.</p>

which I shoulde have
grieved at more on our owne Accounts,
had it not broken off alle further Collision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
with <i>Will</i>. Thoroughlie homesick, while
abroad, poor <i>Father</i> was; then, on his
Return, he noe sooner sett his Foot a-land,
than the King summoned him to <i>Woodstock</i>.
'Twas a Couple o' Nights after he
left us, that <i>Will</i> and I were roused by
<i>Patteson's</i> shouting beneath our Window,
"Fire, Fire, quoth <i>Jeremiah</i>!" and the
House was a-fire, sure enow. Greate
Part of the Men's Quarter, together with
alle the Out-houses and Barns, consumed
without Remedie, and alle through the
Carelessnesse of <i>John Holt</i>. Howbeit,
noe Lives were lost, nor any one much
hurt; and we thankfullie obeyed deare
<i>Father's</i> Behest, soe soone as we received
the same, that we woulde get us to Church,
and there, upon our Knees, return humble
and harty Thanks to <span class="smcap">Almighty God</span> for
our late Deliverance from a fearfulle Death.
Alsoe, at <i>Father's</i> Desire, we made up to

the poor People on our Premises theire
various Losses, which he bade us doe, even
if it left him without soe much as a Spoon.</p>

<p>But then came an equallie unlookt-for,
and more appalling Event: the Fall of
my <i>Lord Cardinall</i>, whereby my Father
was shortlie raised to the highest Pinnacle
of professional Greatnesse; being made
<i>Lord Chancellor</i>, to the Content, in some
Sort, of <i>Wolsey</i> himself, who sayd he was
the onlie Man fit to be his Successor.</p>

<p>The unheard-of Splendour of his Installation
dazzled the Vulgar; while the
Wisdom that marked the admirable Discharge
of his daylie Duties, won the
Respect of alle thinking Men, but surprized
none who alreadie knew <i>Father</i>.
On the Day succeeding his being sworn
in, <i>Patteson</i> marched hither, and thither,
bearing a huge Placard, inscribed, "Partnership
Dissolved;" and apparelled himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in an old Suit, on which he had
bestowed a Coating of black Paint, with
Weepers of white Paper; assigning for't
that "his Brother was dead." "For
now," quoth he, "that they've made
him <i>Lord Chancellor</i>, we shall ne'er see
Sir <i>Thomas</i> more."</p>

<p>Now, although the poor <i>Cardinall</i> was
commonlie helde to shew much Judgment
in his Decisions, owing to the naturall
Soundness of his Understanding, yet, being
noe Lawyer, Abuses had multiplied during
his Chancellorship, more especiallie in the
Way of enormous Fees and Gratuities.
<i>Father</i>, not content with shunning base
Lucre in his proper Person, will not let
anie one under him, to his Knowledge,
touch a Bribe; whereat <i>Dancey</i>, after his
funny Fashion, complains, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Fingers of my <i>Lord Cardinall's</i>
veriest Door-keepers were tipt with Gold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
but I, since I married your Daughter,
have got noe Pickings; which in your
Case may be commendable, but in mine
is nothing profitable."</p>

<p><i>Father</i>, laughing, makes Answer,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your Case is hard, Son <i>Dancey</i>, but I
can onlie say for your Comfort, that, soe
far as Honesty and Justice are concerned,
if mine owne Father, whom I reverence
dearly, stoode before me on the one
Hand, and the Devil, whom I hate
extremely, on the other, yet, the Cause
of the latter being just, I shoulde give
the Devil his Due."</p>

<p><i>Giles Heron</i> hath found this to his Cost.
Presuming on his near Connexion with my
Father, he refused an equitable Accommodation
of a Suit, which, thereon, coming
into Court, <i>Father's</i> Decision was given
flat agaynst him.</p>

<p>His Decision agaynst <i>Mother</i> was equallie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
impartiall, and had Something comique in
it. Thus it befelle.&mdash;A Beggar-woman's
little Dog, which had beene stolen from
her, was offered my <i>Mother</i> for Sale, and
she bought it for a Jewel of no greate
Value. After a Week or soe, the Owner
finds where her Dog is, and cometh to
make Complaynt of the Theft to <i>Father</i>,
then sitting in his Hall. Sayth <i>Father</i>,
"Let's have a faire Hearing in open Court;
thou, Mistress, stand there where you
be, to have impartial Justice; and thou,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Dame <i>Alice</i>, come up hither, because
thou art of the higher Degree. Now
then, call each of you the Puppy, and
see which he will follow." Soe <i>Sweetheart</i>,
in spite of <i>Mother</i>, springs off to the
old Beggar-woman, who, unable to keep
from laughing, and yet moved at Mother's
Losse, sayth,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell 'ee what, Mistress ... thee
shalt have 'un for a Groat."</p>

<p>"Nay," sayth <i>Mother</i>, "I won't mind
giving thee a Piece of Gold;" soe the
Bargain was satisfactorily concluded.</p>

<p><i>Father's</i> Despatch of Businesse is such,
that, one Morning before the End of
Term, he was tolde there was noe other
Cause nor Petition to be sett before him;
the which, being a Case unparalleled, he
desired mighte be formally recorded.</p>

<p>He ne'er commences Businesse in his
owne Court without first stepping into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the Court of King's Bench, and there
kneeling down to receive my Grandfather's
Blessing. <i>Will</i> sayth 'tis worth
a World to see the Unction with which
the deare old Man bestows it on him.</p>

<p>In Rogation-week, following the Rood
as usuall round the Parish, <i>Heron</i> counselled
him to go a Horseback for the
greater Seemlinesse, but he made Answer
that 'twoulde be unseemlie indeede for
the Servant to ride after his Master going
afoot.</p>

<p>His Grace of <i>Norfolk</i>, coming yesterday
to dine with him, finds him in the Church-choir,
singing, with a Surplice on.</p>

<p>"What?" cries the <i>Duke</i>, as they walk
Home together, "my <i>Lord Chancellor</i>
playing the Parish-clerk? Sure, you
dishonour the King and his Office."</p>

<p>"Nay," says <i>Father</i>, smiling, "your
Grace must not deem that the King,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
your Master and mine, will be offended
at my honouring <i>his</i> Master."</p>

<p>Sure, 'tis pleasant to heare <i>Father</i> taking
the upper Hand of these great Folks: and
to have 'em coming and going, and waiting
his Pleasure, because he is the Man
whom the King delighteth to honour.</p>

<p>True, indeed, with <i>Wolsey</i> 'twas once
the same; but <i>Father</i> neede not feare the
same Ruin; because he hath <span class="smcap">Him</span> for
his Friend, whom <i>Wolsey</i> said woulde not
have forsaken him had he served <span class="smcap">Him</span>
as he served his earthly Master. 'Twas
a misproud Priest; and there's the Truth
on't. And <i>Father</i> is not misproud; and
I don't believe we are; though proud of
him we cannot fail to be.</p>

<p>And I know not why we may not be
pleased with Prosperitie, as well as patient
under Adversitie; as long as we say,
"Thou, <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, hast made our Hill soe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
strong." 'Tis more difficult to bear with
Comelinesse, doubtlesse; and envious Folks
there will be; and we know alle Things
have an End, and everie Sweet hath its
Sour, and everie Fountain its Fall; but
... 'tis very pleasant for all that.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">T</span>he Days of Mourning for
my Grandsire are at an
end; yet <i>Father</i> still goeth
heavilie. This Forenoon,
looking forthe of my
Lattice, I saw him walking along the
River Side, his Arm cast about <i>Will's</i>
Neck; and 'twas a dearer Sight to my
Soul than to see the <i>King</i> walking there
with his Arm around <i>Father's</i> Neck.
They seemed in such earnest Converse,
that I was avised to ask <i>Will</i>, afterwards,
what they had been saying. He told me
that, after much friendly Chat together on
this and that, <i>Father</i> fell into a Muse, and
presently, fetching a deep Sigh, says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would to <span class="smcap">God</span>, Son <i>Roper</i>, on Condition
three Things were well established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in Christendom, I were put into a Sack,
and cast presently into the <i>Thames</i>."
<i>Will</i> sayth,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What three soe great Things can
they be, <i>Father</i>, as to move you to such
a Wish?"</p>

<p>"In Faith, <i>Will</i>," answers he, "they
be these.&mdash;First, that whereas the most
Part of Christian Princes be at War,
they were at universal Peace. Next,
that whereas the Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is at
present sore afflicted with divers Errors
and Heresies, it were well settled in a
godly Uniformity. Last, that this Matter
of the <i>King's</i> Marriage were, to the Glory
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and the Quietness of alle Parties,
brought to a good Conclusion."</p>

<p>Indeed, this last Matter preys on my
Father's Soul. He hath even knelt to
the King, to refrain from exacting Compliance
with his Grace's Will concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
it; movingly reminding him, even with
Tears, of his Grace's own Words to him
on delivering the Great Seal, "First look
unto <span class="smcap">God</span>, and, after <span class="smcap">God</span>, unto me."
But the King is heady in this Matter;
stubborn as a Mule or wild Ass's Colt,
whose Mouths must be held with Bit
and Bridle if they be to be governed at
alle; and the King hath taken the Bit
between his Teeth, and there is none
dare ride him. Alle for Love of a brown
Girl, with a Wen on her Throat, and
an extra Finger.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">T</span>hus sayth <i>Plato</i>: of Him

<p>Hear also what St. <i>John</i> sayth: "<span class="smcap">God</span>

<p>Hard, indeed. Here's <i>Father</i> agaynst

once could not speak well enough; and
now he says that if he upholds such and
such Opinions his dear <i>Erasmus</i> may be
the Devil's <i>Erasmus</i> for what he cares.
And here's <i>Father</i> at Issue with half the
learned Heads in Christendom concerning
the King's Marriage. And yet, for alle
that, I think <i>Father</i> is in the Right.</p>

<p>He taketh Matters soe to Heart that
e'en his Appetite fails. Yesterday he put
aside his old favourite Dish of Brewis,
saying, "I know not how 'tis, good
<i>Alice</i>; I've lost my Stomach, I think,
for my old Relishes" ... and this,
e'en with a Tear in his Eye. But 'twas
not the Brewis, I know, that made it

<p>A Burst of Tears was no more than
was to be lookt for from poor Mother;
and, in Sooth, we alle felt aggrieved and
mortyfide enough; but 'twas a short
Sorrow; for <i>Father</i> declared that he had
cast <i>Pelion</i> and <i>Ossa</i> off his Back into the
bottomless Pit; and fell into such funny
Antics that we were soon as merry as
ever we were in our Lives. <i>Patteson</i>, so
soon as he hears it, comes leaping and
skipping across the Garden, crying, "A
fatted Calf! let a fatted Calf be killed,
Masters and Mistresses, for this my
Brother who was dead is alive again!"
and falls a kissing his Hand. But poor
<i>Patteson's</i> Note will soon change; for
<i>Father's</i> diminished State will necessitate
the Dismissal of all extra Hands; and
there is manie a Servant under his Roof
whom he can worse spare than the poor
Fool.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<p>In the Evening he gathers us alle about
him in the Pavilion, where he throws
himself into his old accustomed Seat, casts
his Arm about <i>Mother</i>, and cries, "How
glad must <i>Cincinnatus</i> have been to
spy out his Cottage again, with <i>Racilia</i>
standing at the Gate!" Then, called
for Curds and Cream; sayd how sweet
the soft Summer Air was coming over the
River, and bade <i>Cecil</i> sing "The King's
Hunt's up." After this, one Ballad after
another was called for, till alle had sung
their Lay, ill or well, he listing the While
with closed Eyes, and a composed Smile
about his Mouth; the two Furrows between
his Brows relaxing graduallie till
at length they could no more be seene.
At last he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who was that old Prophet that could
not or would not prophesy for a King
of <i>Judah</i> till a Minstrel came and played
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
unto him? Sure, he must have loved,
as I do, the very lovely Song of one that
playeth well upon an Instrument, yclept
the Human Heart; and have felt, as I
do now, the Spirit given him to speak
of Matters foreign to his Mind. 'Tis
of <i>res angusta domi</i>, dear Brats, I must
speak; soe, the sooner begun, the sooner
over. Here am I, with a dear Wife
and eight loved Children ... for my
Daughters' Husbands and my Son's
Wife are my Children as much as any;
and <i>Mercy Giggs</i> is a Daughter too ...
nine Children, then, and eleven Grandchildren,
and a Swarm of Servants to
boot, all of whom have as yet eaten
what it pleased them, and drunken what
it suited them at my Board, without its
being any one's Businesse to say them
nay. 'Twas the dearest Privilege of my
<i>Lord Chancellor</i>; but now he's dead and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
gone, how shall we contract the Charges
of Sir <i>Thomas More</i>?"</p>

<p>We looked from one to another, and
were silent.</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye, dear ones," he went on.
"I have been brought up at <i>Oxford</i>, at an
Inn of Chancery, at Lincoln's Inn, and
at the King's Court; from the lowest
Degree, that is, to the highest; and yet
have I in yearly Revenues at this Present,
little above one Hundred Pounds
a-year; but then, as <i>Chilo</i> sayth, 'honest
Loss is preferable to dishonest Gain:
by the first, a Man suffers once; by the
second for ever;' and I may take up my
Parable with <i>Samuel</i>, and say: 'Whose
Ox have I taken? whose Ass have I
taken? whom have I defrauded? whom
have I oppressed? of whose Hand have
I received any Bribe to blinde mine Eyes
therewith?' No, my worst Enemies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
cannot lay to my Charge any of these
Things; and my Trust in you is, that,
rather than regret I should not have
made a Purse by any such base Methods,
you will all cheerfully contribute your
Proportions to the common Fund, and
share and share alike with me in this
my diminished State."</p>

<p>We all gat about him, and by our Words
and Kisses gave Warrant that we would.</p>

<p>"Well, then," quoth he, "my Mind
is, that since we are all of a Will to
walk down-hill together, we will do
soe at a breathing Pace, and not drop
down like a Plummet. Let all Things
be done decently and in order: we
won't descend to <i>Oxford</i> Fare first, nor
yet to the Fare of <i>New Inn</i>. We'll
begin with <i>Lincoln's Inn</i> Diet, whereon
many good and wise Men thrive well;
if we find this draw too heavily on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Common-Purse, we will, next Year,
come down to <i>Oxford</i> Fare, with which
many great and learned Doctors have
been conversant; and, if our Purse
stretch not to cover e'en this, why, in
Heaven's Name! we'll go begging together,
with Staff and Wallet, and sing
a <i>Salve Regina</i> at every good Man's Door,
whereby we shall still keep Company,
and be merry together!"</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">N</span>ow that the first Surprise
and Grief, and the first
Fervour of Fidelity and
Self-devotion have passed
off, we have subsided into
how deep and holy a Quiet!</p>

<p>We read of the Desertion of the World,
as a Matter of Course; but, when our
own Turn comes, it does seem strange, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
find ourselves let fall down the Stream
without a single Hand outstretched to
help us; forgotten, in a Moment, as
though we had never been, by those who
lately ate and laughed at our Table. And
this, without any Fault or Offence of
ours, but merely from our having lost the
Light of the <i>King's</i> Countenance. I say,
it does seem strange; but how fortunate,
how blessed are those to whom such a
Course of Events <i>only</i> seems strange, unaccompanied
by Self-reproach and Bitterness!
I could not help feeling this,
in reading an affectionate Letter deare
<i>Father</i> writ this Forenoon to <i>Erasmus</i>,
wherein he sayd, "I have now obtained
what, from a Child, I have continually
wished! that, being entirely quit of
Businesse and all publick Affairs, I
might live for a Time only to <span class="smcap">God</span> and
myself."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>Having no Hankering after the old
Round he soe long hath run, he now,
in Fact, looks younger every Day; and
yet, not with the same Kind of Youth he
had before his Back was bowed under the
Chancellorship. 'Tis a more composed,
chastised Sort of Rejuvenescence: rather
the soft Warmth of Autumn, which sometimes
seems like May, than May itself:
the enkindling, within this mortal Tabernacle,
of a heavenly Light that never
grows dim, because it is immortal; and
burns the same yesterday, to-day, and for
ever: a Youthfulness of Soul and Mind
characterised by Growth; Something with
which this World and its fleeting Fancies
has nothing to do: Something that the
<i>King</i> can neither impart nor take away.</p>

<p>... We have had a tearfull Morning
... poor <i>Patteson</i> has gone. My Father
hath obtained good Quarters for him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
my <i>Lord Mayor</i>, with a Stipulation that
he shall retain his Office with the <i>Lord
Mayor</i> for the Time being, as long as he
can fill it at all. This suits <i>Patteson</i>, who
says he will sooner shift Masters year by
year, than grow too fond of any Man
again, as he hath of <i>Father</i>; but there
has been sad blubbering and blowing of
Noses.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">T</span>his Afternoon, coming
upon <i>Mercy</i> seated in the
Alcove, like unto the
Image of some Saint in
a Niche, her Hands folded
on her Lap, and her Eyes steadfastly agaze
on the setting Sun, I could not but mark
how Years were silentlie at work upon
her, as doubtless upon us alle; the tender,
fearfulle Girl having thus graduallie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
changed into the sober, high-minded
Woman. She is so seldom seene in
Repose, so constantly astir and afoot in
this or that kind Office, mostly about
the Children, that I had never thought
upon it before; but now I was alle at
once avised to marvel that she who had
so long seemed fitter for Heaven than
Earth, shoulde never literallie have vowed
herself the Spouse of <i>Christ</i>; more in
especiall as all Expectation of being the
Spouse of anie else must long since have
died within her.</p>

<p>I sayd, "<i>Mercy</i>, thou lookst like a
Nun: how is't thou hast ne'er become
one in Earnest?"</p>

<p>She started; then sayd, "Could I be
more usefull? more harmless? less exposed
to Temptation? or half so happy
as I am now? In sooth, <i>Meg</i>, the
Time has been when methought, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
sweet the living Death of the Cloister!
How good that must needs be which
had the Suffrages of <i>Chrysostom</i> the
golden-mouthed, and holy <i>Ambrose</i>, and
our own <i>Anselm</i>! How peacefull, to
take Wing like the Dove, and fly away
from a naughty World, and be at Rest!
How brave, to live alone, like St.
<i>Antony</i>, in the Desert! only I would
have had some Books with me in my
Cave, and 'tis uncertayn whether St.
<i>Antony</i> had Knowledge of Letters, beyond
the heaven-taught Lesson, '<span class="smcap">God</span>
is Love,' ... for methought so much
Reflection and no Action would be too
much for a Woman's Mind to bear&mdash;I
might goe mad: and I remembered
me how the Dove that gladly flew away
from the Ark, gladly flew back, and
abode in the Ark till such Time as a
new Home was ready for her. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
methought, cannot I live apart from
Sin here, and now; and as to Sorrow,
where can we live apart from that?
Sure, we may live on the Skirts of the
World in a Spiritt as truly unworldlie,
as though we were altogether out of
it: and here I may come and go, and
range in the fresh Air, and love other
Folks' Children, and read my Psalter,
and pore over the Sayings of the wise
Men of old, and look on the Faces I
love, and sit at the Feet of Sir <i>Thomas
More</i>. Soe there, <i>Meg</i>, are my poor
Reasons for not caring to be a Nun.
Our deare Lord is in himself all that
our highest, holiest Affections can seek
or comprehend; for he made these our
Hearts; he gave us these our Affections;
and through them the Spirit
speaks. Aspiring to their Source, they
rise up like the white Smoke and bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Flame; while, on Earth, if left unmastered,
they burn, suffocate, and destroy.
Yet they have their natural and
innocent Outlets even here; and a
Woman may warm herself by them
without Scorching, and yet be neither
a Wife nor a Nun."</p>

my gratefull Sense of our present Happiness
... "Yes, <i>Meg</i>," returns he, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
too, am deeply thankful for this breathing
Space."</p>

<p>"Do you look on it as no more, then?"
I sayd.</p>

<p>"As no more, <i>Meg</i>: we shall have a
Thunder-clap by-and-by. Look out on
the <i>Thames</i>. See how unwontedlie clear
it is, and how low the Swallows fly.... How distinctlie we see the green
Sedges on <i>Battersea</i> Bank, and their reflected
Images in the Water. We can
almost discern the Features of those
poor Knaves digging in the Cabbage
Gardens, and hear 'em talk, so still is
the Air. Have you ne'er before noted
these Signs?"</p>

<p>"A Storm is brewing," I sayd.</p>

<p>"Aye, we shall have a Lightning-flash
anon. So still, <i>Meg</i>, is also our moral
Atmosphere just now. <span class="smcap">God</span> is giving
us a breathing Space, as he did to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Egyptians before the Plague of Hail,
that they might gather their live Stock
within Doors. Let us take for Example
them that believed and obeyed him;
and improve this holy Pause."</p>

<p>Just at this Moment, a few heavie
Drops fell agaynst the Window Pane, and
were seene by both. Our Eyes met; and
I felt a silent Pang.</p>

<p>"Five Days before the <i>Passover</i>," resumed
<i>Father</i>, "all seemed as still and
quiet as we are now; but <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> knew
his Hour was at hand. E'en while he
yet spake familiarly among the People,
there came a Sound from Heaven, and
they that stood by said it thundered;
but <i>he</i> knew it for the Voice of his dear
Father. Let us, in like Manner, when
the Clap cometh, recognise in it the
Voice of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and not be afraid with
any Amazement."</p>

<p><i><span class="drop-cap-p">G</span>ammer Gurney</i> is dead,
and I must say I am glad
of it. The Change, to her,
must be blessed, and there
seemed some Danger lest,
after having escaped being ducked for a
Witch, she shoulde have been burnt for
a Heretic. <i>Father</i> looked on her as an
obstinate old Woman; <i>Will</i> counted her
little short of a Saint and Prophetess, and
kept her well supplied with alle she could
need. Latterly she was stone deaf; so
'tis a happy Release.</p>

<p>The settled Purpose of <i>Father's</i> Soul,
just now, is to make up a Marriage
between <i>Mercy</i> and Dr. <i>Clement</i>. 'Tis
high Advancement for her, and there
seems to have been some old Liking

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">T</span>hough some Months
have passed since my
Father uttered his warning
Voice, and all continues
to go quiet, I
cannot forbear, now and then, to call his
Monition to Mind, and look about for
the Cloud that is to bring the Thunder-clap;
but the Expectation sobers rather
than saddens me.</p>

<p>This Morning, leaning over the River
Wall, I was startled by the cold, damp
Hand of some one from behind being laid
on mine. At the same Time a familiar
Voice exclaimed, "Canst tell us, Mistress,
why Fools have hot Heads and Hands
icy cold?"</p>

<p>I made Answer, "Canst tell me, <i>Patteson</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
why Fools should stray out of
Bounds?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's what Fools do every
Day," he readily replied; "but this is
<i>All Fools' Day</i>, mine own special Holiday;
and I told my <i>Lord Mayor</i> overnight,
that if he lookt for a Fool this
Morning, he must look in the Glass.
In sooth, Mistress <i>Meg</i>, I should by
Rights wear the Gold Chain and he the
Motley; for a proper Fool he is, and I
shall be glad when his Year's Service
to me is out. The worst o' these Lord
Mayors is, that we can't part with 'em
till their Time's up. Why now, this
present one hath not so much Understanding
as would foot an old Stocking;
'twas but yesterday when, in Quality
of my Taster, he civilly enough makes
over to me a half-eaten Plate of Gurnet,
which I wave aside, thus, saying, I eat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
no Fish of which I cannot affirm, '<i>rari
sunt Boni</i>,' few are the Bones ... and I
protest to you he knew it not for Fool's
Latin. Thus I'm driven, from mere
Discouragement, to leave prating for
listening, which thou knowest, Mistress,
is no Fool's Office; and among the
sundrie Matters I hear at my Lord's
Table ... for he minds not what he
says before his Servants, thereby giving
new Proof 'tis he shoulde wear the
Motley ... I note his saying that the
<i>King's</i> private Marriage will assuredlie
be made publick this coming Easter, and
my Lady <i>Anne</i> will be crowned ...
more by token, he knows the Merchant
that will supply the <i>Genoa</i> Velvet and
Cloth of Gold, and the Masquers that
are to enact the Pageant. For the Love
o' Safety, then, Mistress <i>Meg</i>, bid thy
good <i>Father</i> e'en take a Fool's Advice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and eat humble Pie betimes, for doubt
not this proud Madam to be as vindictive
as <i>Herodias</i>, and one that, unless
he appease her full early, will have his
Head set before her in a Charger. I've
said my Say."</p>

One <i>Parnell</i> complaineth of

gave <i>Father</i> a gilt Flaggon. To the noe

somewhat too exultantlie, "will ye list

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">A</span> heavier Charge than
either of the above hath
been got up, concerning
the wicked Woman of <i>Kent</i>,
with whom they accuse him
of having tampered, that, in her pretended
Revelations and Rhapsodies, she might
utter Words against the <i>King's</i> Divorce.
His Name hath, indeed, been put in the
Bill of Attainder; but, out of Favour, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hath been granted a private Hearing, his
Judges being, the new Archbishop, the
new Chancellor, his Grace of <i>Norfolk</i>, and
Master <i>Cromwell</i>.</p>

<p>He tells us that they stuck not to the
Matter in Hand, but began cunningly
enow to sound him on the <i>King's</i> Matters;
and finding they could not shake him, did
proceed to Threats, which, he told 'em,
might well enow scare Children, but not
him; and as to his having provoked his
Grace the <i>King</i> to sett forth in his Book
aught to dishonour and fetter a good
Christian, his Grace himself well knew
the Book was never shewn him save for
verbal Criticism when the Subject-matter
was completed <i>by the Makers of the same</i>,
and that he had warned his Grace not to
express soe much Submission to the Pope.
Whereupon they with great Displeasure
dismissed him, and he took Boat for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
<i>Chelsea</i> with mine Husband in such gay
Spiritts, that <i>Will</i>, not having been privy
to what had passed, concluded his Name
to have beene struck out of the Bill of
Attainder, and congratulated him thereupon
soe soone as they came aland, saying,
"I guess, <i>Father</i>, all is well, seeing you
thus merry."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, son <i>Roper</i>," returns <i>Father</i>
steadilie; repeating thereupon, once or
twice, this Phrase, "All is well."</p>

<p><i>Will</i>, somehow mistrusting him, puts
the Matter to him agayn.</p>

<p>"You are then, <i>Father</i>, put out of the
Bill?"</p>

<p>"Out of the Bill, good Fellow?" repeats
<i>Father</i>, stopping short in his Walk,
and regarding him with a Smile that <i>Will</i>
sayth was like to break his Heart....
"Wouldst thou know, dear Son, why I
am so joyful? In good Faith, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
given the Devil a foul Fall; for I have
with those Lords gone so far, as that
without great Shame I can ne'er go
back. The first Step, <i>Will</i>, is the worst,
and that's taken."</p>

<p>And so, to the House, with never another
Word, <i>Will</i> being smote at the Heart.</p>

<p>But, this Forenoon, deare <i>Will</i> comes
running in to me, with Joy all bright,
and tells me he hath just heard from
<i>Cromwell</i> that <i>Father's</i> Name is in sooth
struck out. Thereupon, we go together
to him with the News. He taketh it
thankfully, yet composedly, saying, as he
lays his Hand on my Shoulder, "In faith,
<i>Meg</i>, <i>quod differtur non aufertur</i>." Seeing
me somewhat stricken and overborne, he
sayth, "Come, let's leave good <i>Will</i> awhile
to the Company of his own select and
profitable Thoughts, and take a Turn
together by the Water Side."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p>Then closing his Book, which I marked
was <i>Plato's PhÃ¦don</i>, he steps forthe with
me into the Garden, leaning on my
Shoulder, and pretty heavilie too. After
a Turn or two in Silence, he lightens his
Pressure, and in a bland, peaceifying Tone
commences <i>Horace</i> his tenth Ode, Book
second, and goes through the first fourteen
or fifteen Lines in a kind of lulling
Monotone; then takes another Turn or
two, ever looking at the <i>Thames</i>; and in
a stronger Voice begins his favourite</p>

<p class="date">
<i>"Justum, ac tenacem Propositi Virum<br />
Non Civium Ardor," etc.</i><br />
</p>

<p>on to</p>

<p class="date">
"<i>Impavidum ferient RuinÃ¦</i>;"<br />
</p>

<p>&mdash;and lets go his Hold on me to extend
his Hand in fine, free Action. Then,
drawing me to him agayn, presentlie
murmurs, "I reckon that the Sufferings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of this present Time are not worthy
to be compared with the Glory which
shall be revealed in us.... Oh no,
not worthy to be compared. I have
lived; I have laboured; I have loved.
I have lived in them I loved; laboured
for them I loved; loved them for whom
I laboured; my Labour has not been
in vayn. To love and to labour is
the Sum of living, and yet how manie
think they live who neither labour nor
love! Agayn, how manie labour and
love, and yet are not loved; but I have
beene loved, and my Labour has not
been in vayn. Now, the Daye is far
spent, and the Night is at hand, and
the Time draweth nigh when Man
resteth from his Labours, even from his
Labours of Love; but still he shall love
and he shall live where the Spiritt sayth
he shall rest from his Labours, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
where his Works do follow him, for
he entereth into Rest through and to
Him who is Life, and Light, and
Love."</p>

<p>Then looking steadfastlie at the <i>Thames</i>,
"How quietlie," sayth he, "it flows on!
This River, <i>Meg</i>, hath its Origin from
seven petty Springs somewhither amongst
the <i>Gloucestershire</i> Hills, where they
bubble forthe unnoted save by the Herd
and Hind. Belike, they murmur over
the Pebbles prettily enough; but a great
River, mark you, never murmurs. It
murmured and babbled too, 'tis like,
whilst only a Brook, and brawled away
as it widened and deepened and chafed
agaynst Obstacles, and here and there
got a Fall, and splashed and made much
Ado, but ever kept running on towards
its End, still deepening and widening;
and now towards the Close of its Course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
look you how swift and quiet it is,
running mostly between Flats, and with
the dear blue Heaven reflected in its
Face." ...</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">'T</span>was o' <i>Wednesdaye</i> was a
Week, we were quietly
taking our Dinner, when,
after a loud and violent
Knocking at the outer
Door, in cometh a Pursuivant, and summoneth
<i>Father</i> to appear next Daye before
the Commissioners, to take the newly-coined
Oath of Supremacy. <i>Mother</i> utters
a hasty Cry, <i>Bess</i> turns white as Death,
but I, urged by I know not what suddain
Impulse to con the new Comer's Visage
narrowly, did with Eagerness exclaim,
"Here's some Jest of <i>Father's</i>; 'tis only
<i>Dick Halliwell</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>Whereupon, <i>Father</i> burst out a-laughing,
hugged <i>Mother</i>, called <i>Bess</i> a
silly Puss, and gave <i>Halliwell</i> a Groat
for's Payns. Now, while some were
laughing, and others taking <i>Father</i> prettie
sharplie to Task for soe rough a Crank,
I fell a muzing, what could be the
Drift of this, and coulde only surmize
it mighte be to harden us beforehand,
as 'twere, to what was sure to
come at last. And the Pre-apprehension
of this soe belaboured my alreadie
o'erburthened Spiritts, as that I was
fayn to betake myself to the Nurserie,
and lose all Thought and Reflection in
my little <i>Bess's</i> prettie Ways. And, this
not answering, was forct to have Recourse
to Prayer; then, leaving my Closett,
was able to return to the Nurserie, and
forget myselfe awhile in the Mirth of
the Infants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>Hearing
Voyces beneathe
the
Lattice,
I lookt
forthe, and
behelde his
Grace of <i>Norfolk</i>
(of late a
strange Guest)
walking beneath
the Window in
earnest Converse
with <i>Father</i>; and, as
they turned about, I
hearde him say, "By the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Mass, Master <i>More</i>, 'tis perilous striving
with Princes. I could wish you, as a
Friend, to incline to the <i>King's</i> Pleasure;
for <i>Indignatio Principis Mors est</i>."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" says <i>Father</i>; "why
then there will be onlie this Difference
between your Grace and me,
that I shall die to-daye, and you to-morrow;"&mdash;which
was the Sum of
what I caught.</p>

<p>Next Morning, we were breaking our
Fast with Peacefullnesse of Heart, on the
Principle that sufficient for the Daye is
the Evill thereof, and there had beene a
wordy War between our two Factions of
the <i>Neri</i> and <i>Bianchi</i>, <i>Bess</i> having defalked
from the Mancheteers on the Ground
that black Bread sweetened the Breath
and settled the Teeth, to the no small
Triumph of the Cob Loaf Party; while
<i>Daisy</i>, persevering at her Crusts, sayd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
"No, I can cleave to the Rye Bread as
steddilie as anie among you, but 'tis vayn
of <i>Father</i> to maintain that it is as toothsome
as a Manchet, or that I eat it to
whiten my Teeth, for thereby he robs
Self-deniall of its Grace."</p>

<p><i>Father</i>, strange to say, seemed taken at
Vantage, and was pausing for a Retort,
when <i>Hobson</i> coming in and whispering
Somewhat in his Ear, he rose suddainlie
and went forthe of the Hall with him,
putting his Head back agayn to say,
"Rest ye alle awhile where ye be,"
which we did, uneasilie enow. Anon he
returns, brushing his Cap, and says
calmlie, "Now, let's forthe to Church,"
and clips <i>Mother's</i> Arm beneathe his owne
and leads the Way. We follow as soon
as we can; and I, listing to him more
than to the Priest, did think I never
hearde him make Response more composedlie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
nor sing more lustilie, by the
which I founde myself in stouter Heart.
After Prayers, he is shriven, after which
he saunters back with us to the House;
then brisklie turning on his Heel, cries
to my Husband, "Now, <i>Will</i>, let's toward,
Lad," and claps the Wicket after him,
leaving us at t'other Side without so
much as casting back a parting Look.
Though he evermore had beene avised
to let us companie him to the Boat, and
there kiss him once and agayn or ever
he went, I know not that I should have
thoughte much of this, had not <i>Daisy</i>,
looking after him keenly, exclaymed somewhat
shortlie as she turned in Doors, "I
wish I had not uttered that Quip about
the Cob-loaf."</p>

<p>Oh, how heavilie sped the Day! The
House, too big now for its Master's diminished
Retinue, had yet never hitherto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
seemed lonesome; but now a Somewhat
of drearie and dreadfull, inexpressible in
Words, invisible to the Eye, but apprehended
by the inner Sense, filled the
blank Space alle about. For the first
Time, everie one seemed idle; not only
disinclined for Businesse, but as though
there were Something unseemlie in addressing
one's Self to it. There was nothing
to cry about, nothing to talk over, and
yet we alle stoode agaze at each other in
Groups, like the Cattle under the Trees
when a Storm is at hand. <i>Mercy</i> was the
first to start off. I held her back and
said, "What is to do?" She whispered,
"Pray." I let her Arm drop, but <i>Bess</i>
at that Instant comes up with Cheeks as
colourless as Parchment. She sayth, "'Tis
made out now. A Pursuivant <i>de Facto</i>
fetched him forthe this Morning." We
gave one deep, universal Sigh; <i>Mercy</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
broke away, and I after her, to seek the
same Remedy, but alack, in vayn....</p>

<p>Having declared his Inabilitie to take

while they administered it to sundrie
others, thus affording him Leisure for
Re-consideration. But they might as

before its Hour. When called in agayn,
he was as firm as ever, so was given in
Ward to the <i>Abbot</i> of <i>Westminster</i> till the

And now, the Fool's wise Saying of vindictive

coulde fetch Breath or Heart to give it us.
At length <i>Daisy</i>, kissing her Hand once

somewhat after this Fashion.</p>

<p>"And what sayd he, <i>Mother</i>, to

<p>"Why, then, Sweetheart, he chucks
me under the Chin and sayeth, 'I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
for a House that woulde soe soone
forget its Master?'"</p>

<p>"And then, <i>Mother</i>? and then?"</p>

<p>"Soe then, Sweetheart, he sayth,
'Come tell me, Mrs. <i>Alice</i>, how long
do you think we might reckon on living
to enjoy it?' Soe I say, 'Some twenty
Years, forsooth.' 'In faith,' says he,
'had you said some thousand Years, it
had beene Somewhat; and yet he were
a very bad Merchant that woulde put
himselfe in Danger to lose Eternity for
a thousand Years ... how much the
rather if we are not sure to enjoy it one
Day to an End?' Soe then he puts me
off with Questions, How is <i>Will</i>? and
<i>Daisy</i>? and <i>Rupert</i>? and this one? and
t'other one? and the Peacocks? and
Rabbits? and have we elected a new
King of the Cob-loaf yet? and has <i>Tom</i>
found his Hoop? and is the Hasp of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the Buttery-hatch mended yet? and
how goes the Court? and what was the
Text o' <i>Sunday</i>? and have I practised
the Viol? and how are we off for
Money? and why can't he see <i>Meg</i>?
Then he asks for this Book and t'other
Book, but I've forgot their Names,
and he sayth he's kept mighty short
of Meat, though 'tis little he eats,
but his Man <i>John a Wood</i> is gay an'
hungry, and 'tis worth a World to see
him at a salt Herring. Then he gives
me Counsell of this and that, and puts
his Arm about me and says, 'Come, let
us pray;' but while he kept praying
for one and t'other, I kept a-counting of
his gray Hairs; he'd none a Month
agone. And we're scarce off our Knees,
when I'm fetched away; and I say,
'When will you change your Note, and
act like a wise Man?' and he sayth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
'When? when?' looking very profound;
'why, ... when Gorse is out of Blossom
and Kissing out of Fashion.' Soe
puts me forthe by the Shoulders with
a Laugh, calling after me, 'Remember
me over and over agayn to them alle,
and let me see <i>Meg</i>.'"</p>

<p>... I feel as if a String were tied tight
about my Heart. Methinketh 'twill burst
if we goe on long soe.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">T</span>he <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
begins to cut us
short. We are now on
very meagre Commons,
dear <i>Mother</i> being obliged
to pay fifteen Shillings a
week for the Board, poor as it is, of <i>Father</i>
and his Servant. She hath parted with
her Velvet Gown, embroidered overthwart,
to my Lady <i>Sands'</i> Woman. Her Mantle
edged with Coney went long ago.</p>

<p>But we lose not Heart; I think mine
is becoming annealed in the Furnace, and
will not now break. I have writ somewhat
after this Fashion to him....
"What do you think, most dear <i>Father</i>,
doth comfort us at <i>Chelsea</i>, during this
your Absence? Surelie, the Remembrance
of your Manner of Life among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">N</span>ow that I've come back,
let me seek to think, to
remember.... Sure, my
Head will clear by-and-by!
Strange, that Feeling
shoulde have the Masterdom of Thought
and Memory, in Matters it is most concerned
to retayn.</p>

<p>... I minded to put the Haircloth and
Cord under my Farthingale, and one or
two of the smaller Books in my Pouch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
as alsoe some Sweets and Suckets such as
he was used to love. <i>Will</i> and <i>Bonvisi</i>
were a-waiting for me; and deare <i>Bess</i>,
putting forthe her Head from her Chamber
Door, cries piteously, "Tell him, dear
<i>Meg</i>, tell him ... 'twas never soe sad to
me to be sick ... and that I hope ...
I pray ... the Time may come ..."
then falls back swooning into <i>Dancey's</i>
Arms, whom I leave crying heartilie over
her, and hasten below to receive the confused
Medley of Messages sent by every
other Member of the House. For mine
owne Part, I was in such a tremulous
Succussion as to be scarce fitt to stand or
goe; but Time and the Tide will noe
Man bide, and, once having taken Boat,
the cool River Air allayed my fevered
Spiritts; onlie I coulde not for awhile
get ridd of the Impression of poor <i>Dancey</i>
crying over <i>Bess</i> in her Deliquium.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>I think none o' the three opened our
Lips before we reached <i>Lambeth</i>, save, in
the <i>Reach</i>, <i>Will</i> cried to the Steersman,
"Look you run us not aground," in a
sharper Voyce than I e'er heard from
him. After passing the <i>Archbishop's</i> Palace,
whereon I gazed full ruefullie, good <i>Bonvisi</i>
beganne to mention some Rhymes he
had founde writ with a Diamond on one
of the Window-panes at <i>Crosby House</i>,
and would know were they <i>Father's</i>? and
was't the Chamber <i>Father</i> had used to
sleep in? I tolde him it was, but knew
Nought of the Distich, though 'twas like
enow to be his. And thence he went on
to this and that, how that <i>Father's</i> cheerfulle,
funny Humour never forsook him,
nor his brave Heart never quelled; instancing
his fearlesse Passage through the
Traitor's Gate, asking his Neighbours
whether <i>his</i> Gait were that of a Traditor;
and, on being sued by the Porter for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
upper Garment, giving him his <i>Cap</i>,
which he sayd was uppermost. And
other such Quips and Passages, which I
scarce noted nor smiled at, soe sorry was
I of Cheer.</p>

<p>At length we stayed rowing: <i>Will</i> lifted
me out, kissed me, heartened me up; and,
indeede, I was in better Heart then, having
been quietlie in Prayer a good While.
After some few Forms, we were led
through sundrie Turns and Passages; and,
or ever I was aware, I founde myself quit
of my Companions and in <i>Father's</i> Arms.</p>

<p>We both cried a little at first; I
wonder I wept noe more, but Strength
was given me in that Hour. As soone
as I coulde, I lookt him in the Face, and
he lookt at me, and I was beginning to
note his hollow Cheeks, when he sayd,
"Why, <i>Meg</i>, you are getting freckled;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
soe that made us bothe laugh. He sayd,
"You shoulde get some Freckle-water of
the Lady that sent me here; depend on
it, she hath Washes and Tinctures in
Plenty; and after all, <i>Meg</i>, she'll come
to the same End at last, and be as the
Lady all Bone and Skin, whose ghastlie
Legend used to scare thee soe when
thou wert a Child. Don't tell that
Story to thy Children; 'twill hamper
'em with unsavoury Images of Death.
Tell them of heavenlie Hosts a-waiting
to carry off good Men's Souls in fire-bright
Chariots, with Horses of the Sun,
to a Land where they shall never more
be surbated and weary, but walk on
cool, springy Turf and among Myrtle
Trees, and eat Fruits that shall heal
while they delight them, and drink the
coldest of cold Water, fresh from the
River of Life, and have Space to stretch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
themselves, and bathe, and leap, and
run, and, whichever Way they look,
meet <i>Christ's</i> Eyes smiling on them.
Sure, <i>Meg</i>, who would live, that coulde
die? One mighte as lief be an Angel
shut up in a Nutshell as bide here.
Fancy how gladsome the sweet Spirit
woulde be to have the Shell cracked!
no matter by whom; the King, or
King's Mistress.... Let her dainty
Foot but set him free, he'd say, 'For
this Release, much Thanks.' ... And
how goes the Court, <i>Meg</i>?"</p>

<p>"In Faith, <i>Father</i>, never better....
There is Nothing else there, I hear, but
Dancing and Disporting."</p>

<p>"Never better, Child, sayst thou?
Alas, <i>Meg</i>, it pitieth me to consider
what Misery, poor Soul, she will
shortlie come to. These Dances of
hers will prove such Dances that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
will spurn our Heads off like Footballs;
but 'twill not be long ere her Head
will dance the like Dance. Mark you,
<i>Meg</i>, a Man that restraineth not his
Passions, hath always Something cruel
in his Nature, and if there be a Woman
toward, she is sure to suffer heaviest
for it, first or last.... Seek Scripture
Precedent for't ... you'll find it as
I say. Stony as Death, cruel as the
Grave. Those <i>Pharisees</i> that were, to
a Man, convicted of Sin, yet haled a
sinning Woman before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
woulde fain have seene the Dogs lick
up her Blood. When they lick up
mine, deare <i>Meg</i>, let not your Heart be
troubled, even though they shoulde hale
thee to <i>London Bridge</i>, to see my Head
stuck on a Pole. Think, most dear'st,
I shall then have more Reason to weep
for thee than thou for me. But there's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
noe weeping in Heaven; and bear in
Mind, <i>Meg</i>, distinctlie, that if they send
me thither, 'twill be for obeying the
Law of <span class="smcap">God</span> rather than of Men. And
after alle, we live not in the bloody,
barbarous old Times of Crucifyings and
Flayings, and immersing in Cauldrons
of boiling Oil. One Stroke, and the
Affair's done. A clumsy Chirurgeon
would be longer extracting a Tooth.
We have oft agreed that the little Birds
struck down by the Kite and Hawk
suffer less than if they were reserved to
a naturall Death. There is one sensible
Difference, indeed, between us. In our
Cases, Preparation is a-wanting."</p>

<p>Hereon, I minded me to slip off the
Haircloth and Rope, and give the same
to him, along with the Books and Suckets,
all which he hid away privatelie, making
merry at the last.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>"'Twoulde tell well before the Council,"
quoth he, "that on searching the Prison-cell
of Sir <i>Thomas More</i>, there was
founde, flagitiouslie and mysteriouslie
laid up ... a piece of Barley-sugar!"</p>

<p>Then we talked over sundrie Home-matters;
and anon, having now both of
us attayned unto an equable and chastened
Serenitie of Mind, which needed not any
false Shows of Mirth to hide the naturall
Complexion of, he sayth, "I believe, <i>Meg</i>,
they that have put me here ween they
have done me a high Displeasure; but
I assure thee on my Faith, mine owne
good Daughter, that if it had not beene
for my Wife, and for you, my dear
good Children, I woulde faine have
beene closed up, long ere this, in as
strait a Room, and straiter too."</p>

<p>Thereon, he shewed me how illegal
was his Imprisonment, there being noe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Statute to authorize the Imposition of
the Oath, and he delivered himself, with
some Displeasure, agaynst the King's ill
Counsellors.</p>

<p>"And surelie, <i>Meg</i>," quoth he, "'tis
pitie that anie Christian Prince shoulde,
by a flexible Council readie to follow his
Affections, and by a weak Clergy lacking
Grace to stand constantly to the
Truth as they have learned it, be with
Flattery so constantly abused. The
Lotus Fruit fabled by the Ancients,
which made them that ate it lose all
Relish for the daylie Bread of their own
Homes, was Flattery, <i>Meg</i>, as I take
it, and Nothing else. And what less
was the Song of the Syrens, agaynst
which <i>Ulysses</i> made his Sailors stop
their Ears, and which he, with all his
Wisdom, coulde not listen to without
struggling to be unbound from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Mast? Even Praise, <i>Meg</i>, which,
moderately given, may animate and
cheer forward the noblest Minds, yet
too lavishly bestowed, will decrease and
palsy their Strength, e'en as an Over-dose
of the most generous and sprightlie
Medicine may prove mortiferous. But
Flattery is noe Medicine, but a rank
Poison, which hath slayn Kings, yea,
and mighty Kings; and they who love
it, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> knoweth afar off; knoweth
distantlie, has no care to know intimatelie,
for they are none of his."</p>

<p>Thus we went on, from one Theme to
another, till methinketh a heavenlie Light
seemed to shine alle about us, like as when
the Angel entered the Prison of <i>Peter</i>.
I hung upon everie Word and Thought
that issued from his Lips, and drank them
in as thirsty Land sucks up the tender
Rain.... Had the Angel of Death at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that Hour come in to fetch both of us
away, I woulde not have sayd him nay,
I was soe passively, soe intenselie happy.
At length, as Time wore on, and I knew
I shoulde soone be fetcht forthe, I
coulde not but wish I had the Clew to
some secret Passage or Subterraneal, of
the which there were doubtless Plenty
in the thick Walls, whereby we might
steal off together. <i>Father</i> made Answer,
"Wishes never filled a Sack. I make
it my Businesse, <i>Meg</i>, to wish as little
as I can, except that I were better and
wiser. You fancy these four Walls
lonesome; how oft, dost thou suppose,
I here receive <i>Plato</i> and <i>Socrates</i>, and
this and that holy Saint and Martyr?
My Gaolers can noe more keep them
out than they can exclude the Sunbeams.
Thou knowest, <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> stood
among his Disciples when the Doors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
were shut. I am not more lonely than
St. <i>Anthony</i> in his Cave, and I have
a divine Light e'en here, whereby to
con the Lesson, '<span class="smcap">God</span> is Love.' The
Futility of our Enemies' Efforts to make
us miserable was never more stronglie
proven to me than when I was a
mere Boy in <i>Cardinall Morton's</i> Service.
Having unwittinglie angered one of
his Chaplains, a choleric and even
malignant-spirited Man, he did, of his
owne Authoritie, shut me up for some
Hours in a certayn damp Vault, which,
to a Lad afeard of Ghosts and devilish
Apparitions, would have beene fearsome
enow. Howbeit, I there cast myself on
the Ground with my Back sett agaynst
the Wall, and mine Arm behind my
Head, this Fashion ... and did then
and there, by reason of a young Heart,
quiet Conscience, and quick Phansy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
conjure up such a lively Picture of the
Queen o' the Fairies' Court, and alle the
Sayings and Doings therein, that never
was I more sorry than when my Gaoler
let me goe free, and bade me rise up
and be doing. In place, therefore, my
Daughter, of thinking of me in thy
Night Watches as beating my Wings
agaynst my Cage Bars, trust that <span class="smcap">God</span>
comes to look in upon me without
Knocking or Bell-ringing. Often in
Spiritt I am with you alle; in the
Chapel, in the Hall, in the Garden;
now in the Hayfield, with my Head on
thy Lap, now on the River, with <i>Will</i>
and <i>Rupert</i> at the Oar. You see me
not about your Path, you won't see my
disembodied Spiritt beside you hereafter,
but it may be close upon you once and
agayn for alle that: maybe, at Times
when you have prayed with most Passion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
or suffered with most Patience, or performed
my Hests with most Exactness,
or remembered my Care of you with
most Affection. And now, good Speed,
good <i>Meg</i>, I hear the Key turn in the
Door.... This Kiss for thy Mother,
this for <i>Bess</i>, this for <i>Cecil</i>, ... this
and this for my whole School. Keep
dry Eyes and a hopefull Heart; and
reflect that Nought but unpardoned Sin
shoulde make us weep for ever."</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">P</span>arliament will meet
to-morrow. 'Tis expected
<i>Father</i> and the good Bishop
of <i>Rochester</i> will be attainted
for Misprision of Treason
by the slavish Members thereof; and
though not given hithertoe unto much
Heede of Omens and Bodements while
our Hearts were light and our Courage
high, yet now the coming Evill seemeth
foreshadowed unto alle by I know not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
how many melancholick Presages, sent,
for aught we know, in Mercy. Now
that the days are dark and short, and the
Nights stormy, we shun to linger much
after Dusk in lone Chambers and Passages,
and what was sayd of the Enemies of
<i>Israel</i> may be nigh sayd of us, "that a
falling Leaf shall chase them." I'm
sure "a going in the Tops of the Mulberry
Trees" on a blusterous Evening,
is enow to draw us alle, Men, Mothers,
and Maids, together in an Heap.... We
goe aboute the House in Twos and Threes,
and care not much to leave the Fireside.
Last <i>Sunday</i> we had closed about the
Hearth, and little <i>Bill</i> was a reading by
the Fire-light how <i>Herodias'</i> Daughter
danced off the Head of St. <i>John</i> the
<i>Baptist</i>, when down comes an emptie
Swallow's Nest tumbling adown the
Chimnie, bringing with it enow of Soot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Smoke, and Rubbish to half smother us
alle; but the Dust was nothing to the
Dismay thereby occasioned, and I noted
one or two of our bravest turn as pale as
Death. Then, the Rats have skirmished
and gallopped behind the Wainscoat more
like a Troop of Horse than a Herd of
such small Deer, to the infinite Annoyance
of <i>Mother</i>, who coulde not be more firmly
persuaded they were about to leave a
falling House, if, like the scared Priests
in the Temple of <i>Jerusalem</i>, she had
heard a Voyce utter, "Let us depart
hence." The round upper Half of the
Cob-loaf rolled off the Table this Morning;
and <i>Rupert</i>, as he picked it up, gave
a Kind of Shudder, and muttered somewhat
about a Head rolling from the
Scaffold. Worse than this was o' <i>Tuesday</i>
Night.... 'Twas Bed-time, and yet
none were liking to goe, when, o' suddain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
we hearde a Screech that made every
Body's Heart thrill, followed by one or
two hollow Groans. <i>Will</i> snatches up
the Lamp and runs forth, I close following,
and alle the others at our Heels;
and after looking into sundrie deserted
Cup-boards and Corners, we descend the
broad Stone Steps of the Cellars, half way
down which <i>Will</i>, stumbling over something
he sees not, takes a flying Leap to
clear himself down to the Bottom, luckily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
without extinguishing the Lamp. We
find <i>Gillian</i> on the Steps in a Swoon; on
bringing her to, she exclayms about a
Ghost without a Head, wrapped in a
Winding-sheet, that confronted her and
then sank to the Ground as she entered
the Vaults. We cast a fearfulle Look
about, and descry a tall white Sack of
Flour, recently overturned by the Rats,
which clears up the Mystery, and procures
<i>Gillian</i> a little Jeering; but we alle
return to the Hall with fluttered Spiritts.
Another Time I, going up to the Nurserie
in the Dark, on hearing Baby cry, am
passed on the Stairs by I know not what,
breathing heavilie. I reache forthe my
Arm, but pass cleare through the spirituall
Nature, whatever it is, yet distinctlie feel
my Cheek and Neck fanned by its Breath.
I turn very faint, and get Nurse to goe
with me when I return, bearing a Light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
yet think it as well to say nought to
distress the rest.</p>

</div>

<p>But worst of alle was last Night....
After I had beene in Bed awhile, I minded
me that deare <i>Will</i> had not returned me
<i>Father's</i> Letter. I awoke him, and asked
if he had broughte it up Stairs; he
sleepily replied he had not, soe I hastily
arose, threw on a Cloke, took a Light,
and entered the Gallery; when, half-way
along it, between me and the pale Moonshine,
I was scared to behold a slender
Figure alle in white, with naked Feet and
Arms extended. I stoode agaze, speechlesse,
and to my Terror made out the
Features of <i>Bess</i> ... her Eyes open,
but vacant; then saw <i>John Dancey</i> softly
stealing after her, and signing to me with
his Finger on his Lips. She passed without
noting me, on to <i>Father's</i> Door, there
knelt as if in Prayer, making a low sort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of Wail, while <i>Dancey</i>, with Tears running
down his Cheeks, whispered, "'Tis
the third Time of her thus sleep-walking
... the Token of how troubled a
Mind!"</p>

<p>We disturbed her not, dreading that a
suddain Waking might bring on Madness;
soe after making Moan awhile, she
kisses the senseless Door, rises up, moves
towards her own Chamber, followed by
<i>Dancey</i> and me, wrings her Hands a little,
then lies down and graduallie falls into
what seems a dreamlesse Sleep, we watching
her in Silence till she's quiet, and
then squeezing each other's Hands ere
we part.</p>

<p>----<i>Will</i> was wide awake when I got
back; he sayd, "Why, <i>Meg</i>, how long
you have beene! coulde you not lighte
on the Letter?" ... When I tolde
him what had hindered me by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Way, he turned his Face to the Wall
and wept.</p>

In such a Season, Men,

Shelter of their rocking Walls, yet almost
fear to trust them. <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I know that
thou canst give the Tempest double Force,
but do not, I beseech thee! Oh! have
Mercy on the frail Dwelling and the Ship
at Sea.</p>

<p>Dear little <i>Bill</i> hath ta'en a feverish
Attack. I watch beside him whilst his
Nurse sleeps. Earlie in the Night his
Mind wandered, and he told me of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
pretty pyebald Poney, noe bigger than a
Bee, that had golden Housings and Barley-sugar
Eyes; then dozed, but ever and
anon kept starting up, crying, "Mammy
dear!" and softlie murmured, "Oh!"
when he saw I was by. At length I gave
him my Forefinger to hold, which kept
him ware of my Presence without speaking;
but presentlie he stares hard towards
the Foot of the Bed, and says fearfullie,
"<i>Mother</i>, why hangs yon Hatchet in the
Air, with its sharp Edge turned towards
us?" I rise, move the Lamp, and say,
"Do you see it now?" He sayth, "No,
not now," and closes his Eyes. After
a good Space, during the which I hoped
he slept, he says in quite an altered Tone,
most like unto soft, sweet Music, "There's
a pretty little Cherub there now, alle
Head and noe Body, with two little
Wings aneath his Chin; but, for alle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
he's soe pretty, he is just like dear
<i>Gaffer</i>, and seems to know me ... and
he'll have a Body agayn too, I believe,
by and by.... <i>Mother</i>, <i>Mother</i>, tell
<i>Hobbinol</i> there's such a gentle Lamb in
Heaven!" And soe, slept.</p>

onlie transient, whereas a Mother makes
it permanent, by thinking it over and over
agayn. One Lesson it taughte us betimes,
that a naturall Death is not, necessarilie,
the most easie. We must alle die....
As poor <i>Patteson</i> was used to say, "The
greatest King that ever was made, must
bed at last with Shovel and Spade,"
... and I'd sooner have my <i>Billy's</i> Baby
Deathbed than King <i>Harry's</i>, or <i>Nan
Boleyn's</i> either, however manie Years they
may yet carry Matters with a high Hand.
Oh, you Ministers of Evill, whoever ye

<p>Meantime, <i>Father's</i> Foes ... alack
that anie can shew 'emselves such! are
aiming, by fayr Seemings of friendlie
Conference, to draw from him Admissions
they can come at after noe other Fashion.
The new <i>Solicitor Generall</i> hath gone to
the Tower to deprive him of the few
Books I have taken him from Time to
Time.... Ah, Master <i>Rich</i>, you must
deprive him of his Brains afore you can
rob him of their Contents!... and,
while having 'em packt up, he falls into
easie Dialogue with him, as thus, ...
"Why now, sure, Mr. <i>More</i>, were there
an Act of Parliament made that all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Realm shoulde take me for King, you
woulde take me for such with the
Rest."</p>

<p>"Aye, that would I, Sir," returns
<i>Father</i>.</p>

<p>"Forsooth, then," pursues <i>Rich</i>, "we'll
suppose another Act that should make
me the Pope. Woulde you not take
me for Pope?"</p>

<p>"Or suppose another Case, Mr. <i>Rich</i>,"
returns <i>Father</i>, "that another Act shoulde
pass, that <span class="smcap">God</span> shoulde not be
<span class="smcap">God</span>,
would you say well and good?"</p>

<p>"No, truly," returns the other hastily,
"for no Parliament coulde make such
Act lawful."</p>

<p>"True, as you say," repeats <i>Father</i>,
"they coulde not," ... soe eluded the
Net of the Fowler; but how miserable
and unhandsome a Device to lay wait for
him thus!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<p>... I stole forthe, ere 'twas Lighte,
this damp chill Morning, to pray beside
the little Grave, but found dear <i>Daisy</i>
there before me. How Christians love
one another!</p>

<p><i>Will's</i> Loss is as heavie as mine, yet
he bears with me tenderlie. Yesternighte,
he sayth to me half reproachfullie, "Am
not I better unto thee than ten Sons?"</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap-p">B</span>y Reason of <i>Will's</i> minding
to be present at the Triall,
which, for the Concourse
of Spectators, demanded
his earlie Attendance, he
committed the Care of me, with <i>Bess</i>,
to <i>Dancey</i>, who got us Places to see
<i>Father</i> on his Way from the <i>Tower</i> to
<i>Westminster Hall</i>. We coulde not come
at him for the Crowd, but clambered on
a Bench to gaze our very Hearts away
after him as he went by, sallow, thin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
grey-haired, yet in Mien not a Whit cast
down. Wrapt in a coarse woollen Gown,
and leaning on a Staff; which unwonted
Support when <i>Bess</i> markt, she hid her
Eyes on my Shoulder and wept sore, but
soon lookt up agayn, though her Eyes
were soe blinded, I think she coulde not
see him. His Face was calm, but grave,
as he came up, but just as he passed he
caughte the Eye of some one in the
Crowd, and smiled in his old, frank Way;
then glanced up towards the Windows
with the bright Look he hath soe oft
cast to me at my Casement, but saw us
not. I coulde not help crying "<i>Father</i>,"
but he heard me not; perchance 'twas soe
best.... I woulde not have had his Face
cloud at the Sighte of poor <i>Bessy's</i> Tears.</p>

<p>... <i>Will</i> tells me the Indictment was
the longest ever hearde; on four Counts.
First, his Opinion on the King's Marriage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Second, his writing sundrie Letters to the
<i>Bishop of Rochester</i>, counselling him to hold
out. Third, refusing to acknowledge his
Grace's Supremacy. Fourth, his positive
Deniall of it, and thereby willing to deprive
the King of his Dignity and Title.</p>

<p>When the reading of this was over,
the <i>Lord Chancellor</i> sayth, "Ye see how
grievouslie you have offended the King
his Grace, but and yet he is soe mercifulle,
as that if ye will lay aside your
Obstinacie, and change your Opinion,
we hope ye may yet obtayn Pardon."</p>

<p><i>Father</i> makes Answer ... and at
Sounde of his deare Voyce alle Men
hold their Breaths; ... "Most noble
Lords, I have great Cause to thank your
Honours for this your Courtesie ...
but I pray <span class="smcap">Almighty God</span> I may
continue in the Mind I'm in, through
his Grace, until Death."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>
<p>They coulde not make goode their
Accusation agaynst him. 'Twas onlie on
the Last Count he could be made out a
Traitor, and Proof of't had they none;
how coulde they have? He shoulde
have beene acquitted out of hand, 'steade
of which, his bitter Enemy my <i>Lord
Chancellor</i> called on him for his Defence.
<i>Will</i> sayth there was a generall Murmur
or Sigh ran through the Court. <i>Father</i>,
however, answered the Bidding by beginning
to expresse his Hope that the Effect
of long Imprisonment mighte not have
beene such upon his Mind and Body, as
to impair his Power of rightlie meeting
alle the Charges agaynst him ... when,
turning faint with long standing, he
staggered and loosed Hold of his Staff,
whereon he was accorded a Seat. 'Twas
but a Moment's Weakness of the Body,
and he then proceeded frankly to avow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
his having always opposed the <i>King's</i>
Marriage to his Grace himself, which he
was soe far from thinking High Treason,
that he shoulde rather have deemed it
Treachery to have withholden his Opinion
from his Sovereign King when solicited
by him for his Counsell. His Letters to
the good <i>Bishop</i> he proved to have been
harmlesse. Touching his declining to
give his Opinion, when askt, concerning
the Supremacy, he alleged there coulde
be noe Transgression in holding his Peace
thereon, <span class="smcap">God</span> only being cognizant of our
Thoughts.</p>

<p>"Nay," interposeth the <i>Attorney Generall</i>,
"your Silence was the Token of a
malicious Mind."</p>

<p>"I had always understoode," answers
<i>Father</i>, "that Silence stoode for Consent.
<i>Qui tacet, consentire videtur</i>;" which
made Sundrie smile. On the last Charge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
he protested he had never spoken Word
against the Law unto anie Man.</p>

<p>The Jury are about to acquit him,
when up starts the <i>Solicitor Generall</i>, offers
himself as Witness for the Crown, is
sworn, and gives Evidence of his Dialogue
with <i>Father</i> in the Tower, falselie adding,
like a Liar as he is, that on his saying
"No Parliament coulde make a Law that
<span class="smcap">God</span> shoulde not be <span class="smcap">God</span>,"
<i>Father</i> had rejoyned,
"No more coulde they make the
King supreme Head of the Church."</p>

<p>I marvell the Ground opened not at
his Feet. <i>Father</i> brisklie made Answer,
"If I were a Man, my Lords, who regarded
not an Oath, ye know well I
needed not stand now at this Bar. And
if the Oath which you, Mr. <i>Rich</i>, have
just taken, be true, then I pray I may
never see <span class="smcap">God</span> in the Face. In good
Truth, Mr. <i>Rich</i>, I am more sorry for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
your Perjurie than my Perill. You
and I once dwelt long together in one
Parish; your manner of Life and Conversation
from your Youth up were
familiar to me, and it paineth me to tell
ye were ever held very light of your
Tongue, a great Dicer and Gamester,
and not of anie commendable Fame
either there or in the <i>Temple</i>, the Inn
to which ye have belonged. Is it
credible, therefore, to your Lordships,
that the Secrets of my Conscience touching
the Oath, which I never woulde
reveal, after the Statute once made,
either to the King's Grace himself, nor
to anie of you, my honourable Lords,
I should have thus lightly blurted out
in private Parley with Mr. <i>Rich</i>?"</p>

<p>In short, the Villain made not goode
his Poynt: ne'erthelesse, the Issue of this
black Day was aforehand fixed; my Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
<i>Audley</i> was primed with a virulent and
venomous Speech; the Jury retired, and
presentlie returned with a Verdict of
Guilty; for they knew what the King's
Grace woulde have 'em doe in that
Case.</p>

<p>Up starts my Lord <i>Audley</i>;&mdash;commences
pronouncing Judgment, when&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Lord," says <i>Father</i>, "in my
Time, the Custom in these Cases was
ever to ask the Prisoner before Sentence,
whether he coulde give anie Reason
why Judgment shoulde not proceed
agaynst him."</p>

<p>My Lord, in some Confusion, puts the
Question.</p>

<p>And then came the frightful Sentence.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, my Soul, I know; there were
Saints of old sawn asunder. Men of
whom the World was not worthy.</p>

<p>... Then he spake unto 'em his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Mind; and bade his Judges and Accusers
farewell; hoping that like as St. <i>Paul</i> was
present and consenting unto St. <i>Stephen's</i>
Death, and yet both were now holy Saints
in Heaven, so he and they might speedilie
meet there, joint Heirs of e'erlasting Salvation.</p>

<p>Meantime, poor <i>Bess</i> and <i>Cecilie</i>, spent
with Grief and long waiting, were forct
to be carried Home by <i>Heron</i>, or ever
<i>Father</i> returned to his Prison. Was't
less Feeling, or more Strength of Body,
enabled me to bide at the Tower Wharf
with <i>Dancey</i>? <span class="smcap">God</span> knoweth. They
brought him back by Water; my poor
Sisters must have passed him.... The
first Thing I saw was the Axe, <i>turned with
its Edge towards him</i>&mdash;my first Note of his
Sentence. I forct my Way through the
Crowd ... some one laid a cold Hand
on mine Arm; 'twas poor <i>Patteson</i>, soe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
changed I scarce knew him, with a Rosary
of Gooseberries he kept running through
his Fingers. He sayth, "Bide your Time,
Mistress <i>Meg</i>; when he comes past,
I'll make a Passage for ye; ... Oh,
Brother, Brother! what ailed thee to
refuse the Oath? <i>I've</i> taken it!" In
another Moment, "Now, Mistress, now!"
and flinging his Arms right and left,
made a Breach through which I darted,
fearlesse of Bills and Halberds, and did
cast mine Arms about <i>Father's</i> Neck. He
cries, "My <i>Meg</i>!" and hugs me to him
as though our very Souls shoulde grow
together. He sayth, "Bless thee, bless
thee! Enough, enough, my Child;
what mean ye, to weep and break mine
Heart? Remember, though I die innocent,
'tis not without the Will of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, who coulde have turned mine
Enemies' Hearts, if 'twere best; therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
possess your Soul in Patience. Kiss
them alle for me, thus and thus ..."
soe gave me back into <i>Dancey's</i> Arms, the
Guards about him alle weeping; but I
coulde not thus lose Sight of him for
ever; soe, after a Minute's Pause, did
make a second Rush, brake away from
<i>Dancey</i>, clave to <i>Father</i> agayn, and agayn
they had Pitie on me, and made Pause
while I hung upon his Neck. This
Time there were large Drops standing on
his dear Brow; and the big Tears were
swelling into his Eyes. He whispered,
"<i>Meg</i>, for <i>Christ's</i> Sake don't unman me;
thou'lt not deny my last Request?" I
sayd, "Oh! no;" and at once loosened
mine Arms. "God's Blessing be with
you," he sayth with a last Kiss. I
coulde not help crying, "My <i>Father</i>, my
<i>Father</i>!" "The Chariot of <i>Israel</i>, and
the Horsemen thereof!" he vehementlie
whispers, pointing upwards with soe passionate
a Regard, that I look up, almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
expecting a beatific Vision; and when I
turn about agayn, he's gone, and I have
noe more Sense nor Life till I find myself
agayn in mine owne Chamber, my Sisters
chafing my Hands.</p>

was waking. Soon after
the first Cock crew, I
hearde a Pebble cast
agaynst my Lattice, knew
the Signall, rose, dressed, stole softlie
down and let myself out. I knew the
Touch of the poor Fool's Fingers; his
Teeth were chattering, 'twixt Cold and
Fear, yet he laught aneath his Breath as
he caught my Arm and dragged me after
him, whispering, "Fool and fayr Lady
will cheat 'em yet." At the Stairs lay
a Wherry with a Couple of Boatmen, and
one of 'em stepping up to me, cries, "Alas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
for ruth, Mistress <i>Meg</i>, what is't ye
do? Art mad to go on this Errand?"
I sayd, "I shall be mad if I goe not,
and succeed too&mdash;put me in, and push
off."</p>

<p>We went down the River quietlie
enow&mdash;at length reach <i>London Bridge</i>
Stairs. <i>Patteson</i>, starting up, says, "Bide

<i>Hobson</i> (for 'twas he) helps me forth,
saying, "<span class="smcap">God</span> speed ye, Mistress....

... Thought I, there be others in that

<p>Nor lookt I up till aneath the Bridge-gate,
when casting upward a fearsome
Look, I beheld the dark Outline of the
ghastly yet precious Relic; and, falling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
into a Tremour, did wring my Hands
and exclaym, "Alas, alas, that Head hath

Pole tremble and sway towards me; and
stretching forth my Apron, I did in an
Extasy of Gladness, Pity, and Horror,
catch its Burthen as it fell. <i>Patteson</i>,
shuddering, yet grinning, cries under his
Breath, "Managed I not well, Mistress?
Let's speed away with our Theft, for
Fools and their Treasures are soon
parted; but I think not they'll follow
hard after us, neither, for there are
Well-wishers to us on the Bridge.

<p><i><span class="drop-cap-p">R</span>izpah</i>, Daughter of <i>Aiah</i>,
did watch her Dead from
the Beginning of Harvest
until the latter Rain, and
suffered neither the Birds
of the Air to light on them by Day, nor
the wild Beasts of the Field by Night.
And it was told the King, but he intermeddled
not with her.</p>

<p><i>Argia</i> stole <i>Polynices'</i> Body by Night
and buried it, for the which, she with
her Life did willingly pay Forfeit. <i>Antigone</i>,
for aiding in the pious Theft, was
adjudged to be buried alive. <i>Artemisia</i>
did make herself her loved one's Shrine,
by drinking his Ashes. Such is the Love
of Women; many Waters cannot quench
it, neither can the Floods drown it. I've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
hearde <i>Bonvisi</i> tell of a poor <i>Italian</i> Girl,
whose Brothers did slay her Lover; and
in Spite of them she got his Heart, and
buried it in a Pot of Basil, which she
watered Day and Night with her Tears,
just as I do my Coffer. <i>Will</i> has promised
it shall be buried with me; layd upon
my Heart; and since then, I've beene
easier.</p>

<p>He thinks he shall write <i>Father's</i> Life,
when he gets more composed, and we are
settled in a new Home. We are to be
cleared out o' this in alle Haste; the King
grutches at our lingering over <i>Father's</i>
Footsteps, and gazing on the dear familiar
Scenes associate with his Image; and
yet, when the News of the bloody Deed
was taken to him, as he sate playing at
Tables with Queen <i>Anne</i>, he started up
and scowled at her, saying, "Thou art
the Cause of this Man's Death!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
<i>Father</i> might well say, during our last
precious Meeting in the Tower, "'Tis I,
<i>Meg</i>, not the King, that love Women.
They belie him; he onlie loves himself."
Adding, with his own sweet
Smile, "Your <i>Gaffer</i> used to say that
Women were a Bag of Snakes, and that
the Man who put his Hand therein
woulde be lucky if he founde one Eel
among them alle; but 'twas onlie in
Sport, <i>Meg</i>, and he owned that I had
enough Eels to my Share to make a
goodly Pie, and called my House the
Eel-pie House to the Day of his Death.
'Twas our Lord <i>Jesus</i> raised up Women,
and shewed Kindnesse unto 'em; and
they've kept theire Level, in the Main,
ever since."</p>

But I fear me, these Matters adhere not
to a Man's Memory ... he'll be telling
of his Doings as Speaker and Chancellor,
and his saying this and that in Parliament.
Those are the Matters Men like to write
and to read; he won't write it after my
Fashion.</p>

<p>I had a Misgiving of <i>Will's</i> Wrath,
that Night, 'speciallie if I failed; but he
called me his brave <i>Judith</i>. Indeed I
was a Woman bearing a Head, but one
that had oft lain on my Shoulder.</p>

<p>My Thoughts beginne to have Connexion
now; but till last Night, I slept
not. 'Twas scarce Sunsett. <i>Mercy</i> had
been praying beside me, and I lay outside
my Bed, inclining rather to Stupor than
Sleep. O' suddain, I have an Impression
that some one is leaning over me, though
I hear 'em not, nor feel theire Breath. I
start up, cry "<i>Mercy!</i>" but she's not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
there, nor anie one else. I turn on my
Side and become heavie to Sleep; but or
ere I drop quite off, agayn I'm sensible or
apprehensive of some living Consciousness
between my closed Eyelids and the setting
Sunlight; agayn start up and stare about,
but there's Nothing. Then I feel like
... like <i>Eli</i>, maybe, when the Child
<i>Samuel</i> came to him twice; and Tears
well into mine Eyes, and I close 'em
agayn, and say in mine Heart, "If he's
at Hand, oh, let me see him next Time
... the third Time's lucky." But
'steade of this, I fall into quiet, balmy,
dreamlesse Sleep. Since then, I've had
an abiding, assuring Sense of Help, of a
Hand upholding me, and smoothing and
glibbing the Way before me.</p>

<p>We must yield to the Powers that be.
At this Present, we are weak, but they
are strong; they are honourable, but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
are despised. They have made us a
Spectacle unto the World, and, I think,
Europe will ring with it; but at this
present Hour, they will have us forth
of our Home, though we have as yet no
certayn Dwelling-Place, and must flee as
scared Pigeons from their Dove-cot. No
Matter; our Men are willing to labour,
and our Women to endure: being reviled,
we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it.
Onlie I marvell how anie honest Man,
coming after us, will be able to eat a
Mouthful of Bread with a Relish within
these Walls. And, methinketh, a dishonest
Man will have sundrie Frights
from the <i>Lares</i> and <i>Lemures</i>. There'll
be Dearth o' black Beans in the
Market.</p>

<p>Flow on, bright shining <i>Thames</i>. A
good brave Man hath walked aforetime
on your Margent, himself as bright, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
usefull, and delightsome as be you, sweet
River. And like you, he never murmured;
like you, he upbore the weary, and gave
Drink to the Thirsty, and reflected Heaven
in his Face. I'll not swell your full
Current with any more fruitless Tears.
There's a River, whose Streams make
glad the City of our <span class="smcap">God</span>. He now rests
beside it. Good Christian Folks, as they
hereafter pass this Spot, upborne on thy
gentle Tide, will, maybe, point this Way,
and say&mdash;"There dwelt Sir <i>Thomas More</i>;"
but whether they doe or not, <i>Vox Populi</i>
is a very inconsiderable Matter. Who
would live on theire Breath? They hailed
St. <i>Paul</i> as <i>Mercury</i>, and then stoned him,
and cast him out of the City, supposing
him to be dead. Theire Favourite of
to-day may, for what they care, goe
hang himself to-morrow in his Surcingle.
Thus it must be while the World lasts;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and the very Racks and Scrues wherewith
they aim to overcome the nobler Spiritt,
onlie test and reveal its Power of Exaltation
above the heaviest Gloom of Circumstance.</p>
